                    Plans written by God (704) (904) (303)



This file will explain how do create a hydrolic bong.  I ran into this type of 
bong at a private party with some friends of mine in 904.  This in essence is 
like funneling a beer.  Except instead of getting incredably drunk you get 
really baked.

Materials you need are:

One plastic garbage can (water proof) or bathtub.
One 3 liter, 2 liter, or one gallon container for the crazy people (like myself)
Sissors
Aluminum foil and a straight pin (or something else to make tiny holes.
Water

Step 1 [The Chamber]

Cut the very bottom of your container off, as shown:
              []
             /  \
             |__|
             |co|
             |ke|
             |||| 
             |||| <-- cut bottom out of container.  Cut VERY low or you will 
                      loose part of your chamber (God (pun intended) forbid)


Step 2 [The Bowl]

Cut a piece of aluminum foil out that will fit into the opening of the 
container well (size should vary on how much pot you wish to smoke).  NOTE: 
you will probably only need to take one hit so make it a good one so you will 
stay baked for a long time.  If you plan on getting so high you can't stop 
laughing, go ahead and take ten hits.  Anyway, poke little holes in there as 
you are all probably familiar with.

Step 3 [The Bong]

Fill the garbage can with water.  NOTE: The garbage can needs to be big 
enough so that your container will fill all the way in it.

Step 4 [Loading up]

Place the container in the water all the way so that only the tip is showing.  
Then place the bowl in the top of the container.  Fill it with pot.  Light 
your lighter (sometimes a match works better) and hold it just above the pot.
SLOWLY pull up on the container.  The flame should be sucked downward into the 
pot.  Lift it up BUT DO NOT let the container's bottom get exposed to the air.  
As this would result in a loss of smoke.  (Your container should now be full 
of smoke.)  See Diagram:

           __  __ = Bowl
           ||
        \ /  \ /
        |_|__|_| <--water level
        | |  | |
        | |  | | (Note there is not bottom on container.)
        |      |
        |______|

Step 5 [Inhaling]

If you plan on being the next president or anything like that skip this step.  
Take the bowl out of the container.  Breath in really deep.  Then exhale.  
Place your mouth over the top of container, and push container DOWN fast, 
while at the same time taking you next large inhale.  USE ALL of the smoke.

See Diagram:
            
            ||   note the bowl is off
  P  ||    /  \
  u  \/    |sm|
  s  \/  \ |ok| /
  h      | |e | |
         |_|__|_| <--water level (note BOTTOM of contain IS still in water)
  D      |      |
  O      |      |
  W      |______|
  N

Step 6 [Done]

You should now be pretty well baked, unless you skipped step 5 in which case 
to impress your friends you should do really stupid things.

Hope you enjoyed this file.
