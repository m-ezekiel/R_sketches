Oh, jeez...

About two years ago, while I was a sophomore in high school, I had a less 
than good experience with some "marijuana" my friend gave me.  I had no 
idea it was laced.  I took the bag over to my best friend's house, and we 
busted out his green three chamber bong with the black drop-bowl.  After 
a few bowls on the green machine, I noticed the room was spinning.  We 
were watching Animaniacs.  Wakko was screaming, and the bald psychiatrist 
was running around or something.  Then, the characters looked like they 
were floating around the room, talking to me!  Well, I loaded another 
bowl in my small purple pipe/steamroller, and we were off.  After about 
twenty minutes, my friend and I were on the floor, trying to stand up and 
get something from the fridge.  As I felt the floor give way out from 
under my body, vomit rose in my throat.  I remember running to the 
bathroom(floating,actually), and gagging.  The thought of vomiting after 
only a 1/4 ounce puzzled me.  Well, soon after that, my head cleared, and 
we were off again(my friend had a bag) on some good shit.  Since then, my 
friend and I have had many good experiences with marijuana.  However, I 
do look at it good and hard now before I spark it up.  I think that's a 
good habit to get into...
