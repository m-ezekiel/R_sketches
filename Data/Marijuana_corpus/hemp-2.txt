                            (And save money....)

                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-



First get some seeds. From either your stash or a friend.

You will have to first germinate your seeds(You could just
stick em in the soil and wait but WHY?)

To germinate:
                Get a clear plastic cassette and stick the
                seed/seeds in then wrap with wet paper towel.
                It will eventually dry, but keep the paper on
                the outside wet. Soon sprouts should appear.

To begin:
                Get a planting pot either small or large
                (Large is better, but if you don't have one
                 use a small one then get a larger one in
                 the future). Fill the pot with some enriched
                soil and moisten overnight. Now your ready to
                start!

To start:   
                CAREFULLY place the germinated seed/seeds in the
                soil. Then place in direct light. If you want an
                outdoor plant then place outdoors in a secluded
                area away from the general public. The plant
                needs light. Try to have the sun/light on it all
                day. After a period of a few weeks the plant
                should be getting bigger, if not then start 
                the process all over. You might have a stunted
                plant.

To maintain:
                Go get some Miracle Grow plant food. The rose
                kind is perfect. Follow the directions on the
                box to feed. Water at least 3 times a week and
                trim if necessary. Try some chicken guts or 
                some light manure to help the process along.
                Wait till plant is 6-12" in height then
                you must transplant it.

To transplant:
                Did you get that big planter yet? Get a LARGE
                planter at a garden store and fill with fresh
                soil. Moisten overnight again. Fertilize lightly
                with manure or Miracle Grow if possible. Now
                dig a hole in the center and make room for the
                old plant. Grab the small pot in your left hand
                and use your right forefinger and middle finger
                and carefully grasp the bottom stem and flip
                upside down. The plant should pop out with the
                pot shaped soil connected to the roots.
                Carefully break up the soil as you place it in
                the hole in the new pot. Try not to damage the 
                roots or the plant itself or it might go into
                shock. When it is firmly seated in the new soil
                pat it down with some new soil until level.
                Follow the above mantaining tips for the remainder
                of the growth. You will need a magnifying glass
                to look at the glands when ready. A female plant
                should have little "buds" growing. If you see
                flowers it is a male plant. The glands will be large
                and look like little sacs ready to burst THC.
                Then you will know you are ready to harvest
                (Approx. 5-7 months later)
              
To harvest:
                
                Either uproot the plant or cut the stem at the
                base. Turn the whole plant or sections upside-
                down. Hang it somewhere in the sun. If you keep
                it in the dark it may become moldy and worthless.
                after a week or so it should be dry enough to 
                package/or smoke. Do not smoke stem or seed,
                other than not getting you high, it will give you
                a splitting headache.

       I do not encourage ANYONE to smoke pot. But do

       what YOU want...Don't follow societies rules...
