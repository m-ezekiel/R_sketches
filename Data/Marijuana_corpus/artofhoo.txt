That is a very piss poor drawing if you didnt notice.  There is a carb on the
other side to get the very best draw/hit you feel optimum for you.  

Hooka was the infamous semi-portable red U.S. Bong that served aproximately
a good 75 people or more in its heyday.  Alot of people owe many hours of
good times to this Bong.  

Finally, this long saga had to come to an end.  One day we were in the 79'
Red Chevy IMPALA driving and enjoying the scenery.  And what do you know,
Mr. Police Man saw us in the not so hot looking IMPALA (The IMPALA Story to
come later).  Mr. Police Man had a very good sense of ameallion, no I mean
smell.  He said "Everybody out of the car please."  We said "Siiure Mr. Police
Man" Forgetting that Hooka was no so safely under the front side passenger
seat.  Mr. Police Man found Hooka, but not the Bowl.  Boy were we ever 
scared.  But good old BOB had packed another bowl and forgot to put it
into Hooka.  So Mr. Police Man said "Well boys, since there is no bowl to
this WATER PIPE, I really can't get you on anything.  But Im gonna take
this WATER PIPE none the less.  The expressions on or face turned to immeadite
saddness.  It was like a part of our lives was just taken away forever.
Mr. Police Man saw our expression, but just snickered and drove away.  We
got the trusty rolling papers out and rolled a nice fat one, and proceeded
to smoke our sorrows away.  


To this day none of us have seen Hooka since that fateful day.  Now everyone
is in college, or working somewhere, and Hooka is just a faded memory.  
But I know and they all know that Hooka will live on for eternity in everyone
who smoked out of her.  



                          God Bless Hooka.
