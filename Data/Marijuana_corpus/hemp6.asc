  Compiled by the Business Alliance for Commerce in Hemp (BACH)

     HEMP HAS A LONG, PROUD HISTORY OF MEDICAL USE AND HUNDREDS OF
THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS.
     For more than 3,500 years, Hemp has been (depending on the
culture or nation) either the most used or one of the most widely
used plants for medicines. This includes: China, India, the Middle
and Near East, Africa and Europe. From 1850 to 1937, Hemp was
America's prime medicine for more than 100 separate illnesses or
diseases.
     Research by Dr. Raphael Mechoulam, etc. indicates that when
Cannabis Hemp is legally available, it will directly replace some
10%-20% of all prescription pharmaceutical drugs and that probably
40%-50% of all medicines could use derivatives of the cannabis
plant.

HEMP FOR HEALTH-Medical uses of Hemp include treating back pain,
asthma, glaucoma, epilepsy, cancer, muscle spasms, migraines,
tumors, stress, depression and anorexia. It is an antibiotic and
expectorant, useful in muscle ointments and to treat arthritis and
rheumatism. Hundreds of other therapeutic uses are likely, but
hard-to-get permits are required to use it, and the federal
government banned research into medical use of Hemp, so millions of
people continue to suffer needlessly, and a valuable herbal
medicine with minimal side-effects is held hostage by out-of-date-
laws.
     Cannabis users statistically live one or two years longer than
non-users. Hemp offers affordable health care for America.
________________________
HEMP HELPS ASTHMA-Medicines based on hemp would be most beneficial
to young people, bringing a lifetime of relief and adding years to
their lives. Asthma symptoms could be permanently reduced. Hemp
eases the symptoms of epilepsy and prevents glaucoma from
developing, bringing effective relief to those unfortunate enough
to suffer from these illnesses.
_________________________
HEMP FOR CANCER-Hemp reduces the nausea suffered by chemotherapy
patients. This same characteristic has also recently been utilized
by AIDS patients and is sometimes indicated for motion sickness
(sea sickness.)
__________________________
HEMP SAVES EYES- Medical Hemp would benefit some 90% of victims of
glaucoma, a blinding disease. Cannabis does not cure it or reverse
the loss of vision, but can halt the glaucoma sufferer's
progressive deterioration of eyesight.
___________________________
HEMP FOR ARTHRITIS & RHEUMATISM-A traditional treatment for these
ailments is to soak cannabis in alcohol and apply it locally in a
poultice.
____________________________
HEMP RELIEVES STRESS-Cannabis reduces mental agitation and ulcers.
One out of two American marriages end in divorce and domestic
violence is on the increase. Studies indicate that these problems
often result from the stress and depressed sex drive associated
with the fast pace of modern life. Hemp is well known for its
ability to reduce stress and promote relaxation, and has long been
regarded as an aphrodisiac, yet it is not available on the open
market.
_____________________________
CANNABIS WAS WITHDRAWN FROM THE AMERICAN PUBLIC in 1938 against the
advice of the medical community. Hemp was moved from the Class 2
schedule of drugs (having demonstrated medical value) and listed as
Class 1 (dangerous substance with no known medical value) by the
Nixon administration in 1970-despite all evidence to the contrary-
and was retained as Class 1 by the Bush administration in 1989.   
     In 1972 the Nixon-appointed Shafer Commission urged that
cannabis be re-legalized, which was not done. Still, medical
research continued--often with remarkable results. Cannabis was
shown to help treat numerous health problems with very few side
effects.
     Eleven states went on to adopt laws authorizing prescription
use of medical marijuana.
______________________________
MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED--At the 1975 National Institute of Drug
Abuse (NIDA) Asilomar Conference, participants were amazed at the
documented results of marijuana research and agreed that a massive
national research project was in order. Instead, all federal
research grants were terminated in 1976 and subsequent private
research has been heavily restricted.
     By late 1983 the Reagan/Bush administration had destroyed
large amounts of data compiled in government sponsored marijuana
research and put out a feeler to private and state universities to
destroy their own records. Most refused to do so.
     In September, 1988, DEA Administrative Judge Francis Young
concluded that cannabis should be rescheduled as Class 2 and made
available for medical use. It has not been. Write to your
representatives and ask that Hemp be re-legalized for use in
America.
     There are thousands of other uses for Hemp: textiles, paper,
fiber, food, fuel, medicine and more.
