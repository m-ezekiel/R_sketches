The most common arguments against ending marijuana prohibition are as easy to refute as they are to summarize:

1.Marijuana alters consciousness.
2.We have so much trouble with alcohol, tobacco and bad driving;     why make matters worse?
3.Ending prohibition will "send the wrong message."
4.Some people just can't cope with marijuana use.
5.Marijuana smokers have no motivation.
6.What about the children?

  Anyone who advocates hemp/marijuana reform will hear these statements time and again. But these engaging yet specious arguments cannot hold up to rational scrutiny.
  Let's look at them individually.

1."Marijuana alters consciousness."
  Granted; but how is that bad? People who argue against getting high on this natural herb often suggest getting "high on life" or "high on God". This says that getting high is not, in itself, wrong.
  The real issue is freedom of thought. Eating chocolate, drinking coffee, watching TV, drinking beer, smoking cigarettes, even prayer and meditation alter consciousness. Who gave prohibitionists the power to dictate to the rest of us what we can or cannot do for fun? Will they ban these pastimes one day, too?
  Neither the U.S. Constitution nor the Bible prohibits marijuana use. In fact, the Bible says God gave man "all" the seed bearing plants to use,and the Declaration of Independence specifically declares that we have a right to the "pursuit of happiness." But people who make certain choices are now persecuted for doing so.

2."We already ahve so much trouble with alcohol, tobacco and bad driving; why make matters worse?"
  If you think we have an aclcohol problem today, just remember the "Roaring Twenties", when competing liquor outlets used to send carloads of gangsters out with machine guns to settle their differences.
  The criminal violence caused by Prohibition (the 18th Ammendment) were so much worse than the effects of drinking that the American people soon voted in the 21st Amendment, and liquor was re-legalized.
  Society has since learned to cope with alcohol use, just as we have accepted marijuana use for thousands of years. People are quick to adapt, and most knowledgeable sources agree that marijuana smokers are generally peaceful, law-abiding people. In fact, they are often among the nices people you'll meet.
  Drinking can lead to reckless driving. You shouldn't drive when using common medicines like antihistamines, either. This is a matter of common sense and personal responsibility.  
No one should ever drive if they are not fully alert and capable of doing so
                                                                                        Also affecting public safety, alcohol and tobacco carry health risks that marijuana does not have. Some 500,000 people a year die from using tobacco or alcohol, but not one single person ever died from smoking marijuana in all of history. In fact, cannabis has hundreds of proven medical uses. Society might set age limits on marijuana use, as we have for alcohol and tobacco, but it is criminal to have set prison terms.

3."Ending marijuana prohibition 'sends the wrong message'-that we condone drugs."
  Prohibition is not about sending messages: It's about sending people to jail. And prison cannot rehabilitate patriotic Americans who blieve that the marijuana law is unconstitutional and immoral.
  Marijuana is not a manufactured drug: It's a natural herb. Some people enjoy smoking it, others don't. It's just a matter of taste. A difference of opinion: And that's what democracy is all about. Experts predict that marijuana use will level off soon after prohibition ends and people will reduce their use of hard drugs.
  So, the real message of prohibition is this: Despite all the safeguards in the Constitution, petty tyrants still spread lies and take away the freedoms of others.
  If we want society to send the "right" message, we must do it through honest educational programs about personal freedom and responsibility. Ending prohibition will be the first part of that lesson.

4."Some people just can't cope with marijuana use."
  That's right: About 10% of Americans have addictive personalities and they should avoid marijuana.
  Each of us has the right to say "no" to marijuana:
But the 90% of us who can control our appetites also have a right to say "yes", if we so desire.
  Let's not ruin our lives with hysterical laws that do nothing to solve the real problems facing society.
 
5."Marijuana smokers have no motivation."
  Blaming marijuana is just a cop out. The Beatles wrote many of their finest tunes while being quite open about smoking pot. Justice Douglas Ginsburg was nominated for the Supreme Court and many members of Congress, as well as successful professionals and working people have smoked marijuana.
  When a person loses motivation, there are usually many factors to consider. They need our understanding and help. Arresting them and putting them in prison does not solve these problems: It makes matters worse.
  Most people prefer to smoke marijuana for relaxation or creative inspiration during leisure hours-not when they have work to do. And if marijuana smokers are so unmotivated, how come it takes urine tests, blood samples and hair analysis to tell who smokes it?
  The simple fact is that most marijuana smokers are highly motivated and productive citizens.

6."What about the children?"
  An excellent question. What kind of world are we making for our children: One full of prisons, secret police and intrusive laws that encourage them to spy on their own parents. I say, let's build them a world that respects each individual while it educates them about the resposible use of freedom.
  This is precisely why we must repeal prohibition. Not only will it protect the rights and liberties that geneterations of Americans have fought and died for: Hemp will also provide our children with a healthy environment and a sustainable economy to live in.
  Throughout history, hemp has been a help to our human society. It now holds the key to our future.
