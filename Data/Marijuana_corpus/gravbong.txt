 Gravity bong is one of the best smoking inventions ever. Fill a large pot 
with ice water. Cut a pepsi bottle ( 1 litter ) at the bottom leaving no 
bottom at all. Take some tin-foil and cover the mouth at the top of the bottle
leaving a "Bowl" by pusing the foil into the mouth. Also you have to make 
"Wings" on the side of the tinfoil so that the foil can be easily sliped on 
and off. Poke holes in the foil with a pin or something. Now place the bottle 
into the water making sure theres not too much water to hit the top of the
bottle. Pack the bowl and light it lifting the bottle at the same time. ( Air 
travels down the mouth of the bottle replacing the water.) At this point if 
the foil is tight around the top not letting any to enter around the sides you
should have a chamber of smoke. Be sure not to lift the bottle out of the 
water of the smoke will escape. Remove the foil while holding the bottle and 
inhale wile letting the bottle go down. Don't go to fast or you'll pass ou. 
Don't go to close to the water or you'll get a lung of it...

Tell me how it turns out.. This method burns alot of pot..
