Ruth, you might try the following references:

Scallet, A.C. Neurotoxicology of cannabis and THC - a review of chronic
exposure studies in animals Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1991 40 671 676

Schwartz, R.H.  Heavy marijuana use and recent memory impairment

cognition       Psychopharmacology      1993    110     219     228

Block, R.I., Farinpour, R. and Braverman, K.    Acute effects of marijuana

The last three by Block and colleagues may be the best *chronic* studies
available.

Also, given that you are neighbors, you might want to get in touch with
the folks at UNTHSC (used to be TCOM) Department of Pharmacology in Fort
Worth. They have a significant presence in Substance Abuse Research and
are heading up the Substance Abuse Insitute of North Texas (SAINT).

Hope this helps, Jonathan
