Cooking With Pot
----------------

        Many people after cleaning their grass throw away the seeds, stems,
and twigs. I would highly recommend that you save these, as there are many
recipes for these odds and ends. A tasty hot drink that resembles tea can be
made very simply by tying up all the waste from your stash into a muslin ball
or into a piece of cheesecloth. Use the quantity you have on hand, as the
quantity will determine the strength and potency. Now, drop the cheesecloth
containing the grass into a kettle of water, and bring the water to a boil.
Allow the kettle to boil for a few minutes, and then remove it from the flame
and let it steep for another five minutes with the grass still inside. After
this, the drink is ready. Just add sugar and lemon to taste.
        If you decide against growing pot, and want to eat your seeds, there 
is an interesting recipe for "seed pancakes". It is prepared by lightly
toasting a quarter of a cup of seeds into a large frying pan. Now, take the
seeds from the frying pan and add them to a mixture of one cup of pancake mix,
one egg, a quarter cup of milk, and one tablespoon of butter. Beat this
mixture until it is smooth and creamy. Heat a frying pan with a small amount
of butter, then pour in pancake batter. Turn the pancakes as they start to  
look done, or when the edges begin to turn brown. Repeat procedure until all
the batter used. Serve pancakes with butter, maple syrup, and honey.
        For a stimulating drink (sounds like all the rest of the cookbooks)
place eight ounces milk, a few spoonfuls sugar, a tablespoon malted milk, half
a banana, a half tablespoon grass, and three betel nuts in a blender. Keep the
blender working full speed for a few minutes, then strain and serve.
        If you like candy, it's very simple to make some using pot. Take a
quarter cup of powdered grass and add water until it equals a full cup. Mix 
this with four cups sugar and two and a half cups corn syrup. Now heat in a
large pot to 310 degrees, and add red food coloring and mint flavoring.
Remove the pot from the stove, and allow the mixture to cool a little, before
pouring it onto wax paper. When the candy's cool, cut it into squares and eat.
        One of the most common recipes for cooking with pot is spaghetti. This
recipe doesn't take too much special preparation: Just when you add your
oregano, add at the same time a quarter cup grass, and allow it to simmer with
the sauce. Be sure to use well-cleaned grass, unless you can get into eating
twigs and stems. Another way of serving pot with spaghetti is to grind it up
very fine and mix it with some ground cheese. Then sprinkle the cheese-pot
mixture over the sauce just before eating.
        Dessert is probably the most important stage of the meal, since it
will be the last thing your guests remember before they pass out all over your
table. For an interesting dessert, grind a quarter ounce of grass very finely 
and add enough water so it forms a paste. Now separately dissolve one and a 
half cups sugar into two cups milk. Add to this your pot paste and one lemon
rind grated. Beat in a half cup heavy cream, until the mixture is firm and
thick. Now pour the mixture into ice cube trays and freeze. Just before you're
ready to serve, rebeat the frozen mush until it becomes light and fluffy.
        Since everyone has a private recipe for an aphrodisiac, why shouldn't
I put one in here? I've heard people tell me, in all seriousness, that they
believe the only true aphrodisiac is a case of beer in the back seat of a
'56 Chevy. Well, if you're not into that, you might as well try this recipe,
because it's got to work better than a case of beer. Pound one tablespoon
unground mace, two cantharides beetles, one teaspoon fresh red saffron, and
one teaspoon of the best quality grass you can find. Pound all the ingredients
together until they form a powder. Now add one pint of water and heat to a
boiling point. After boiling for a few minutes, reduce the heat and simmer for
45 minutes or so, until the liquid is reduced to about a quarter of a cup.
This can be served as a drink or over brown rice. I have not tried this
recipe, as I have been unable to locate any cantharides.
