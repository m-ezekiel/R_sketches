I was over my friends house one weekend and I had the 
Motherload (well the most I ever had at once, a nice fat 25 
grams.) So it was about 1:50 am. sunday... and me and my 
friend had made a coke bottle bong to smoke sum ..... blah blah 
pointless...
After smoking 3 or 4 bongs I was really startin' get stoned, and 
his sister had some cool incense candles that smelled fuckin' 
awesome and since they flickered it was like a strobe... (a really 
cool thing to have while stoned) and I lay down and started 
staring at the ceiling watching they green and red dots make 
landscapes... when I noticed If i didn't concentrate on it his 
sister had a yellowish pulsing glow around her which was really 
cool.... then I noticed my friends face was all distorted and 
melted and in different places an shit.... totally cool.... after 
about fifteen minutes of this I though I heard a little girl scream, 
then a second later I thought it must have been a satan girl  
coming after me with a sycthe, so I ran around like a jack-ass 
closing all the doors and shit... I slammed his sisters window in 
the process breakin' it ... woops then I heard her satan claws 
scratching across the floor coming to his room to kill me. So my 
friend opened his door to prove to me there was no satan girl 
there, all there was was his cat, but I got scared cause it's eyes 
were glowing red and pulsing... so he closed his door and told 
happy stories until I felt better...  then for about an hour I just 
watched little red & green dots make faces and shapes all across 
his ceiling until we all fell asleep in a big on his sisters floor.
I wonder what his parents thought of us lying there like that... 
oh well.. The funniest bit was the next day they're was all 
Buddah on the floor cause we spilled a couple bongs... 

Definately my scariest experience on the Magic Herb...
