The government's war on hemp has turned millions of law-abiding
Americans into criminals with the stroke of a pen. As a result,
America now has the HIGHEST number of prisoners per capita than any
other nation on earth! Advocates of Omnibus Crime Bill pending in
Congress promise to DOUBLE the number of prisoners in the next 20
years! Will we continue to build prisons instead of schools,
subsidize deadly tobacco while we criminalize harmless hemp, waste
hundreds of millions of tax dollars on police arresting marijuana
users while essential services are cut?

"Prohibition...goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts
to control a man's appetite by legislation and make a crime out of
things that are not crimes...A prohibition law strikes a blow at
the very principles upon which our government was founded."
                              ABRAHAM LINCOLN, December 1840
