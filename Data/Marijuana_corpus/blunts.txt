Blunts

What are "blunts?"

       The name, "Blunts," is a street name used to describe a
marijuana and tobacco cigar.  Other street names include "el-pees"
(LP's), According to one source, blunts originated among Jamaicans
in New York City in the early 1980's.(1)  Blunts take their
name from "Phillies Blunt=FC" brand cigars, although other brands of
similar make (such as El Producto=FC, White Owl=FC, and Dutch Masters=
=FC)
are also used for this purpose.
(1)  Tobacco is removed from the inside of the cigar, and
replaced with marijuana.

Blunts vs. Joints
       Smoking marijuana inside the leaf or paper wrapper of a
cigar offers several advantages to the user:
       -The tobacco wrapper slows down the burning rate of the
joint.  This allows a greater number of users to share the same
       joint.(1)
       -A blunt holds more marijuana than a joint, and is
convenient to use and store.  A single user can smoke it,
extinguish it, and easily relight it.  "That's what's so cool about
a blunt.  Just put it out.  It fits nicely in the top pocket."(1)
       -It looks like a legal drug.  Even though it is illegal for
adolescents to use tobacco products, blunts appear to be commercial
tobacco cigars.  Policemen, teachers, and parents who ignore
cigarette possession in minors are likely to ignore blunts as well.
       -Nicotine from the tobacco content may add to the effects of
the marijuana in a blunt.  Nicotine is a stimulant, and marijuana
is a minor hallucinogen with some depressant properties.  Other
stimulant and depressant combinations include cocaine and heroin,
cocaine and alcohol, amphetamines and alcohol.  At this writing,
there appears to be no medical literature evaluating the
psychoactive effects of using marijuana and tobacco together vs.
individually.  However, some of the comments made in one magazine
interview are intriguing and may indicate synergistic effects:
       "The blunt is more effective =FCthan smoking marijuana
       alone=FC..."  "When you smoke a blunt, you get twice as high.
=2E . ."  "At first, I didn't like it, 'cause it made me dizzy. . .

Why are Phillies Blunt=FC cigars used?

       Many other cigar brands are still being used to make blunts.
Users say that the Phillies Blunt=FC brand produces less harsh-
tasting or sweeter smoke.(1)  The leaf wrapper of a
Phillies Blunt=FC is strong enough to hold together through the
manipulations of making a blunt.  Other brands fall apart.

Washington DC Area Trends

       The emergence of blunts in the Washington D.C. area has been
associated with an increase in marijuana abuse among both youth and
adults.(2)  The peaks and dips in positive test results for
marijuana in juvenile arrestees closely resemble increased
Washington DC area sales of the Havatampa Co.'s large cigars,
including the Phillies Blunt=FC brand.(2)

National Trends

       Articles in High Times, a magazine about substance use and
marijuana farming, give methods for making blunts.
(2,3)  Rap music stars featured in the articles
suggested a cultural link between blunts use and rap or hip-hop
music.(2)  The appearance of tee shirts and baseball caps
promoting blunts use in New York, Washington DC, Baltimore, and
California suggest that blunts use is becoming a national
phenomenon.

                            How to Roll a Blunt!
                           By:  Social Distortion
 
 
        The first thing you have to know to roll a blunt, is Practice,
Practice, and Practice.  It takes several tries before you can get it right.
Go to your corner store and buy a pack of Tampa Gold Gars.  Take a razor
blade, and cut it open like this.

                            Cut here.
 
 
        Take all the tobacco out.  Lick the back of the paper, that is, the
outside of the gar, thoroughly.  You really need to make love to these things
with your tounge.  Next, place a healthy portion of weed in the gar.  Roll it
up, and lick the edge thoroughly.  It takes a lot of saliva to make these
things stick.  When you have it closed up, pop it in the microwave for about
ten seconds, this makes it stick better.  The light it up, and smoke it.
 
                           The Ethics of Gars
 
A lot of people think rolling in gars ruins the taste of marijuana.  I
personally think it enhances the taste.  You can take mondo hits, and you'll
definately choke the first time you smoke one.  For the ultimate high, let
someone give you shotgun.  It'll knock you on your ass.  All the people I
know now don't even carry skins anymore, only a pack of gars in their pocket.
It takes longer to roll than a joint, but it's worth the extra effort.
