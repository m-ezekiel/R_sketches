This is a grower's guide for those folks who allready know a thing or two
about growing the dread plant: MARIJUANA.

There are several key factors in growing the optimal or near optimal 
Marijuana plant. These factors can be manipulated to produce different 
physical variations in any seedstock selected. 

                 THEY ARE:

               *01* Light Intensity & Spectrum
               *02* Photoperiod
               *03* Temperature Cycle
               *04* Nutrients
               *05* Humidity Cycle
               *06* CO2
               *07* Pruning
               *08* Leeching
               *09* Cloning
               *10* Stress

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LIGHT *01*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Light Spectrum should be as close as approximation of natural sunlight
as is available. The Light Intensity should be as bright as is possible
while still keeping temperature in line.

There are several kinds of lights that one can use. As far as cost and
security go, I recommend several vertical fluorescent lights suspended 
around the plants with a pair of sylvania SL-100 bulbs in the center.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHOTOPERIOD *02*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the GROWTH PHASE, the light period should be a minimum of 18 
hours. The light can be continuous during the growth 
phase (24 Hours per Day) with profound effects. 

During the FLOWERING PHASE, 12 hours of uninterrupted light stimulates
the production of budding sites for the flowers.

I cannot stress enough that during the FLOWERING PHASE, the dark period 
should not be violated by any light. It delays flower development and 
promotes leaf growth. If you must work on the plants during this time, 
allow only as much light as a VERY pale moon can provide for less than 
5 minutes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEMPERATURE *03*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The atmospheric temperature should be in the low 70's during the day,
dropping into the 50's at night. This rule is not absolute, however. 
If you grow clones or selectively bred seedstock in a area that has a 
temperature range larger than this, the plants will mutate over each 
generation to make plants more and more suited to the environment they 
happen to be in. For example, plants can (with trial & error) be grown 
in a closet with temperatures in the 80's and 90's. However, the closer 
you get to the ideal temperature range, the better the buds and the 
less likely you are to get male plants.(see stress)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FERTILIZER *04*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nutrients should be provided with each watering. A good GROWTH PHASE
mix is 1/4 tsp Peter's 20/20/20 fertilizer per gallon of aged water. During
the FLOWERING PHASE , Peter's African Violet 12/34/16 fertilizer mixed to the 
same proportion works well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HUMIDITY *05*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The humidity should be kept high (around 90%) unless over watering has 
occurred and the soil needs drying quickly. Marijuana doesn't like its roots
to be wet all the time, so don't water every day unless the temperature is
quite high. If proper ventilation is maintained, problems like fungus and 
algae should be minimal.
 
Average watering solution usage:

10 days after transplant--------1 Quart (946 ml)
20 days after transplant--------1.5 Quarts (1419 ml)
30 days after transplant--------2 Quarts (1892 ml)
During Flowering----------------1.5 Quarts (1419 ml)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CO2 *06*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Carbon Dioxide (CO2) levels should be high, particularly during the 
FLOWERING PHASE . Growth rates can be increased dramatically if the 
CO2 level is near 700 ppm. 

                300  ppm (Outside Air)
                700  ppm (Ideal) 
                2000 ppm (Plants Burn) 
                5000 ppm (Death)

CO2 is cheaply produced by burning Natural Gas. However, heat and Carbon
Monoxide must be vented to the outside air. CO2 can be obtained by buying
or leasing cylinders from local welding supply houses. Beware! The DEA
has asked the supply houses to provide lists of large CO2 users. If 
you are questioned, simply say "I have an old mig welder at the house
and I want to try and patch up my (Lawnmower, car, trailer, etc.). If
you find that you are making lots of trips to the supply house, complain
that your "buddy" keeps leaving the cylinder valve open all night. This
should provide a plausible excuse.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRUNING *07*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To maintain the optimal growth rate, trim all leaves that are greater
than 4 inches long (not counting the stem). A good rule of thumb is to
keep the distance (Internodal Length) between the leaves/branches on
the main stem around 1 inch. The more often you trim, the slower the
Marijuana plant will grow and the narrower the internodal length. Trimming 
the growth tip after the plant is 4-5 leaf sets tall will produce a "Y" 
shaped plant with two "arms". Too much trimming will result in poor growth 
and often hermaphroditism. Keep puruning to a minimum during the entire 
FLOWERING PHASE. (see stress)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEECHING THE SOIL *08*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

From time to time, it is beneficial to leach the soil of high concentrations
of salts. The salts come from the fertilizer solution by means of 
evaporation. To leach the soil, over water the growing medium until fluid
can be seen above the soil line. Allow the swampy mess to soak for a few 
minutes, then pump/siphon off excess from the "well" at the lower end of the 
growing area.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLONING (Cutting plantlets) *09*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After Two Months, any Marijuana plant can be cloned. Cut young growth 
tips from a mature plant that are 5 inches long with a stem diameter 
1/5-1/10 inch. Cut with a razor blade or X-Acto knife and immerse the cut 
end of the clones into a tub of water mixed with .5 grams Peters 20-20-20 
per quart. Next, cut the bottom .5 inch off the end while it is submerged. 
Remove the clone from the tub and dip into rootone powder and plant 1 inch 
deep in a saturated Jiffy 7 pod/rockwool/oasis block. Place plantlet in 
a small tub with perlite sprinkled on the bottom and .5 inch of the Peter's 
solution when the cutting is in place. Place Tub/Planter in a plastic tent to 
maintain a very high humidity (85-90%). Place 40 watt fluorescent lamp above 
the tent. Make sure that the plants stay wet, but not standing in water by 
checking them twice daily. Leave lamps on for 24 hours a day. After about Two 
Weeks, Rootlets will appear at the bottom of the pods. Transplant at this 
point to growing area, taking care not to disturb any exposed roots.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRESS *10*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since Marijuana is very responsive to its environment, big changes in any
of the growth factors (light, heat, food, water, etc.) can affect not only
the growth of the plant but also potency and even sex. 

The whole thing is really a trade-off. If you want bigger, faster growing 
buds, then you should increase stress. However, too much stress will force
Hermorphrodisim or even a male from a normally female plant.


                                VOTE OR PERISH!

                   ATTEND CANDIDATES RALLYS AND ASK IF THEY
                  SUPPORT LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA. REMEMBER
                  THEY ACT ON WHAT THEY THINK NICE FOLKS WANT.
                     ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE. IT WORKS.
