If you have an extra ounce kicking around then try this:
Make Marijauna wine!!
Ingredients:
      2 gallons boiling water (spring water is best)
      4 - 8 ounces (fresh) marijauna stalks, leaves, branches
      5 pounds sugar OR 8 pounds honey
      3 oranges, sliced
      3 lemons, sliced
      2 cakes yeast (get this from a wine&beer store)

Preparation:
   Place fresh cannabis in the boiling water, add sugar, orange
   and lemon slices, remove from heat and let stand for several
   days. Add yeast after straining into a clean container - a 
   crock, glass jug, or carboy (get from beermaking store). 
   Then let the mixture ferment for at least two weeks (4 is 
   better) before racking and corking.
  
              Enjoy!!!
