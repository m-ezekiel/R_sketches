I've just received the latest copy of the Sensi Seed Bank catalog from
Holland and thought I'd type in the seed descriptions for your
enjoyment. (Sorry I can't include the pictures, they're great!)

Reading this makes me realize how enlightened the Dutch are. How did
we get to the point where keeping the company of certain plants will
get you a ruined life, courtesy of the Government? Keep up the good
fight, let's make it legal in the US!

                        SENSI   SEED   BANK

All you need, you'll find at Sensi Seed

Sensi Seed Bank B.V. is the first complete growshop in Holland. You'll
find a vast collection of books for beginner or expert, fertilizers
for growing in soil or hydroponics, lighting, ecologically sound crop
protection, growing systems and of course our unique, world-famous
seed collection. In short, a visit to our shop is a must for every
grower!

Grow it and you'll know it!

This leaflet provides you with a survey of all the seeds in our
collection. You'll find a description of the different varieties as
well as some data on harvest times and yields which will help you make
your choice. The plants fall into three categories: 1) Indoor,
2) Indoor/greenhouse, 3) Outdoor.

The indoor flowering period gives the amount of time the plants need
to finish off once you have put them into flowering (12 hours of
light/12 hours of darkness). For the outdoor varieties the data refer
to the approx. date of harvest in Holland. Because of uncertain
weather conditions in September and October we recommend to choose
early varieties for outdoor growing. The data on yield give you an
idea of the possibilities of the different varieties. Since the yield
depends on the grower as well as on the conditions the data are no
guaranteed results. The prices are given for 15 seeds.

We are not able to give any guarantees on these seeds, since we are
dealing with living material. However, we test the viability and
germination rates of all varieties on a regular basis.

The seeds are only meant for agricultural purposes within the
Netherlands. 

NORTHERN LIGHTS (Winner pure indica 88/89/90 -- Indoor)
[photo: mouth watering shot of a sticky bud]

An absolute must for the indoor grower! For the last couple of years
the Northern Lights has dominated the various Harvest Festivals. Through
selective breeding we have succeeded in producing one of the most
powerful plants in the world. On top of that, we have developed a
strain highly adapted for indoor growing: short, stocky plants that
produce maximum yields in the shortest possible time.

Flowering: 45-50 days
Height 100-125 cm
Yield: up to 125 gr
Price: fl. 200.00 [that's Guilders -- 1.8 to the dollar these days. It
                   works out to about $7.50 a seed]


SILVER HAZE (champion 89 -- Indoor)
[photo: mouth watering shot of a sticky bud]

Although the cerebral high of Sativa is preferred by many, indoor
growers aren't too fond of this type: Sativas get very tall, take a
long time to finish off and produce skimpy yields. We have spent years
searching for a superb Indica/Sativa hybrid suited for indoor growing.
By crossing the Haze, the most powerful Sativa in the world, to a
non-dominant Indica we managed to get the height and flowering time
of the plant down to an acceptable level and still retain the unique
Sativa qualities of the high. The result: the Silver Haze, winner of
the '89 High Times Harvest Festival. Don't expect top yields but top
quality that will excite the true connoisseur.

Flowering: 65-75 days
Height: 150-180 cm.
Yield: up to 100 gr.
Price: fl. 200.00

SHIVA SHANTI I (Indoor)

This Afghani with its penetrating Indica aroma is one of the best
yielders in the collection. Due to its top indoor performance combined
with a pleasant taste and high the Shiva Shanti is one of our most
popular varieties.

Flowering: 50-65 days
Height: 110-150 cm
Yield: up to 150 gr.
Price: fl. 60.00

BIG BUD (winner: Mostly Indica '89 -- Indoor)

For sheer yield and hybrid vigor, this is the best yet. The plants
surprise even experienced growers. Huge buds, excellent resin, taste
and high. Somewhat variable, approx. 1 in 4 females will be an extreme
heavy yielder, with the longer flowering plants giving the biggest
yields.

Flowering: 50-65 days
Height: 110-150 cm
Yield: up to 150 gr.
Price: fl. 160.00

NORTHERN LIGHTS #5 X HAZE (Winner: Mostly Sativa '90 -- Indoor)

Finally for sale in Holland: this superb Indica/Sativa hybrid, a cross
between our best Indica and Sativa strains. Extremely potent with
unique Sativa qualities to the high. Due to the Haze influence this
hybrid tends to stretch in height during flowering. Therefore it must
be flowered when very small. An excellent choice for an ebb and flow
table. Cuttings can be put into flowering as soon as they show roots.
The 10 week flowering period is well compensated with an excellent
yield. 

Flowering: 65-75 days
Height: 150-180 cm
Yield: up to 150 gr.
Price: fl. 250.00

FOUR-WAY (indoor)

sweet pungency, but with more resin and better yield. High

RUDERALIS SKUNK (Outdoor)
[photo: mouth watering shot of a field full of sticky bud]

Ruderalis is an early-flowering variety that grows wild in parts of
Eastern Europe and Russia. We have used the early flowering
characteristic of Ruderalis to improve the outdoor performance of some
of our best varieties. The advantage of a Ruderalis hybrid is that
approx. 50% of the seedlings will begin flowering at the 5-7th
internode, regardless of the photoperiod (finishing date Sept. 1). The
other half of the seedlings will be much later (October).

Finish: Sept-Oct.
Height: 2-3 m.
Yield: up to 300 gr.
Price: fl. 80.00

DURBAN (Outdoor)

A very early strain from South Africa. Durban is a compact Sativa with
a sweet aroma and an up high. One of the most reliable early outdoor
varieties, it will produce chunky, solid buds even during the worst
season. If you haven't tried Durban, you are missing out on one of the
easiest to grow, highest-quality early varieties in the world.

Finishing: end of Sept.
Height: 1.5-2.5 m
Yield: up to 400 gr.
Price: fl. 100.00

EARLY SKUNK (Outdoor)

An excellent hybrid between Skunk #1 and Early Pearl. Outdoor growers
are usually dissatisfied wit the finishing date of the regular Skunk
strain. The Early Skunk finishes about 2 weeks earlier than Skunk #1
due to the influence of the Early Pearl. The influence of the latter
is also noticeable in the smell and the high: sweet and smooth. On top
of that: the strain combines a good yield with mold resistance.

Finishing date: Oct. 1
Height: 2-3m.
Yield: up to 500 gr.
Price: fl. 60.00

EARLY GIRL (Outdoor)

This is a mostly Indica variety, one of the earliest in our
collection. Very potent, medium yield, with a hashy taste and aroma.

choice for your balcony!

Height: 1.5-2m.
Yield: up to 250 gr.
Price: fl. 100.00

EARLY PEARL (Outdoor)

Early Pearl has always been one of our most popular outdoor varieties.
Wonderfully sweet and resinous, the plants have a mostly Sativa
dominated growth pattern, with excellent potency. Very mold resistant,
even during the worst season.

Price: fl. 100.00
