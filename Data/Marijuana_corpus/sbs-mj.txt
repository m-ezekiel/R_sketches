 N O T E S
-----------
This was hand typed and not scanned, (damn original too blurry and tiny type)
errors are possible, however it was check for errors multiple times and
spell checked.

This chart contains the penalties for first offense possession, cultivation,
sale and delivery of marijuana. Most states have increased penalties for
subsequent offenses.

Many states also have enhanced penalties for involving minors and offenses
within certain distances of schools, parks, and other public recreation
areas.

Any amount for possession generally means for personal use. Possession of
large amount of marijuana will, in most cases, lead to charges of
possession with intent to distribute (same as sale).

Unit of weight vary from state to state. For comparative purposes:
One ounce = 28.35 grams;
one pound = 453.59 grams;
and one kilogram = 2.2 pounds.

Except where otherwise indicated, sentences are in years.

Except where otherwise indicated, fines are maximum amount.


C: State allows for the conditional release or alternative/diversion
   sentencing of first-time possession offenders.

D: State where marijuana is decriminalized to some degree. See note on
   Alaska

M: State has enacted legislation recognizing the medical use of marijuana for
certain ailments such as glaucoma, nausea associated with chemotherapy and
AIDS treatment, and some spasticity and neurological disorders.
CHARACTERISTICS of STATE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT

The letters beside the states names corresponds with the definitions
listed at the bottom of this file. These 'flags' indicate that the CSA
of the jurisdiction includes the characteristic. Originally this was a
chart with description at the top and states on the left with dots
indicating inclusion or exclusion, I felt this was the easiest way to
get past the graphics.
