    One of the safest ways to grown grass is in the security of your own
home.  This might save you from possible legal consiquences and/ or theft
of the plant itself.
 
Marijuana adapts well to indoor conditions.  You can grow it in sunny rooms
or with artificial light.  The factor limiting the rate of growth indoors
is often the amount of light, since it is less a problem to supply the plants
with plenty of water, nutrients, and air.  Natural light is free.  If feas-
able to use, natural light eliminates the most expensive components for ind-
oor gardeners: artifical lights and the electricity they use.  Window light
is the easiest way to grow plants for decorative purposes or for a small crop
On the other hand, a greenhouse, sunporch, or particulary sunny room can
support larger plants than most artificial light systems.  A sunny porch or
roof area enclosed in sheet plastic to form a greenhouse is a simple, inex-
pensive way to grow pounds of grass.
    Cannabis grows into a fully formed bush when it receives a minimum of
five hours of sunlight a day.  But you can grow good-sized plants of excel-
lent quality with as little as two hours of daily sunlight provided windows
are unobstructed by building or trees and allow full daylight.
 
    Some growers supplement natural light with artificial light from incan-
descent or fluorescent fixtures.  This is essential during the winter, when
sunlight is weaker than the summer, and in spaces where the plants get little
direct sunlight.  Artificial lights can also be used to lengthen the natural
photoperiod in order to grow plants all year.
The best time to plant using natural light is in late March or April, when the
sun's intensity and the number of hours of daylight are increasing.  A good
light bulb tinting would be blue.
 
In its natural state, marijuana may grow an extensive root system.  In dry
areas, the tap root can grow more than six feet deep in its seafch for water.
In moist areas with fertile soil (such as in potting mixtures), the lateral
root remains small, often only three or four inches long on a seven-foot-tall
mature plant.
The purpose of the growing medium is to provide adequate water and nutrients
in addition to anchoring the roots, which hold the plant upright.  By watering
and fertilizing as needed, you could grow a six-foot plant in a four-inch pot
 
Most growers use containers that will hold between tow and five gallons of
soil.  These are good compromise in terms of weight, space, cost, and labor.
They can be moved easily and hold an adequate reservoir of water and nutrients
to sopport a large mature plant.
 
Marijuana must have a well-drained medium for healthy growth.  Soilz that   ld
too much water or hold it unevenly can drown the roots, leading to poor grow-
th or death of the plant.  It prefers a medium that is high in nitrogen, and m
mid-range in phosphorus and potassium (see note at end of file (#1)).
 
Growing methods:
 
1) Pinch or cut back the growing shoots when the plants are young.  This for-
   ces each plant to develop several strong growing shoots and generally
   yields large robust plants.
 
2) Plant a number of plants in each pot.
 
3) Start many plants in small pots and transplant the best plants to larger
   pots when the plants crowd each other.
 
4) Use different light systems to grow plants at different growth stages.
 
 
Sowing:
 
The easiest way to start the plants is to sow the seeds directly into the
soil.  First, wet the soil with a moderate amount of water, enough to get the
soil evenly moist without water running out the bottom.  This takes about
<one-half quart of water for one-galoon containers, and about one quart for
three-gallon containers.  Plant the seeds a quarter -to half-inch deep.  The
germination rate is lower when they are planted deeper; and if seeds are
planted less than one-quarter inch deep, the sprouts may have difficulty anch-
oring their roots.  Plant about six seeds per pot to assure some sprouts in
each pot.  Gently press each seed into the soil.  Cover the seeds with soil
and sprinkle lighly with water.  Each day, sprinkle or spray the surface with
enough water to throughly wet the top half-inch of soil, since the seed must b
be kept moist for germination.
Problems with germination come from either too much or too little water.
If you saturate the pots with water, and especially if you continue to
saturate the pots after the seeds have sprouted, the seedlings may develop
stem rot or root problems.  When the stem rot develops, the base turns brown,
and the seedling fall over, ending the garden.  If the humidity, on the other
hand, is low, the soil surface dries out quickly and the seeds won't
germinate.
The Key to germination is to keep the soil surface moist after first having
moistened the whole pot; then, after the first sprouts have been up for a few
days, let the surface of the soil dry between waterings.  Don't spray the
surface anymore.  Water with medium amounts of water when the soil in the top
couple of inches feels dry.  For small pots, water seedlings about twice a
week.  For larger pots, once each week or two may be enough.
 
Another way would be, starting the seeds in wet towels or a glass of water..
Add one teaspoon of liquid bleach (3%) to each cup of water.  This will preve
nt fungus from attacking the seeds, which happens when they are soaked for
more than three days.  Check the seeds each day.  The sprout should be planted
soon, as delay might might kill it (Transplant shock).
 
Water:
 
During Germination, keep the soil surface moist.  But once the seedling are
established, let the top layer of soil dry out before watering again.
 
Temperature:
 
The plant can withstand temperatures from freezing to over 100F.
Temperatures above 75F will increase growth rate.  The average will be
around 75F to 80F.
 
Other notes:
 
Smoke is not healthy for any living thing, and during a party , when the
concentration of smoke is very high, the plant should be moved to another room
or i  might die (This is not joke).   Another suggestion made by one of my
friends is to blow a fan on the plants when they are about 3 feet tall, this
will strengthen the stem.
 
 
 
Look forward to Part III, which will go in depth with outside gardens.
