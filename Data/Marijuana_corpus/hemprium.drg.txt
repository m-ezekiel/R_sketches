The Cannabis Center and Hemporium

	by Mari Kane, 860 2nd Street, SF CA, 94107-2019

If you're looking for the ultimate in green commodities look no 
further than your local hemporium.  
For years educated hempsters have known about the versatile uses 
of cannabis, and now, the market has woken up and smelled the 
weed!

At the vanguard of hemp retailing stands the Cannabis Center and 
Hemporium.  Less like the traditional psych shop- where potheads 
browse amid black lite posters and water pipes- and more like a 
general store, offering the basic goods of everyday life. But forget 
about getting high from smoking a hemp hanky, it's not going to 
happen  There's not enough THC in these productsto give you 
anything but a wicked headache.

The hemporium features an on-site "Fabric Artist" named Gilbert, 
who will custom-make garments of your fancy using 100% hemp 
fabric, imported from China.  The material bears a striking 
resemblance to linen with it's  natural color, abundance of 
irregularities, and it's propensity to wrinkling.  The heavy gauge 
hemp is stiff, which is better applied to outerwear such as jackets 
and coats. The lighter gauge has more flow, and is preferable for 
skirts, bathrobes, and even pyjamas.  

So what's so great about wearing hemp?  "The durability", explains 
Gilbert, "the fact that it lasts twice as long as cotton is going to give 
the public a reason to demand it. Once the public demands it, we'll 
see different weaves like twill, to make jeans".

China is the biggest supplier of hemp fabric in spite of the fact that 
their mills are working with 1930's American technology..  Hemp 
fiber is relatively inexpensive to buy, but the customs tax paid on 
imported hemp is upwards of 80%!  Gilbert estimates that the price 
of hemp products would be halved by using American-grown hemp, 
and only then would he consider manufacturing a line of hempwear.

As things are, a tailor-made blazer runs around $150.00, and shirts 
from $40.00 to $50.00.  The store also carries Stoned-Wear 
hemp/cotton shorts for $35.00,  Hemp Colony blended shirts at 
$45.00, and House Of Hemp 100% hemp hooded sweatshirts at 
$50.00.

The Hemporium carries a variety of hemp paper, made in the USA 
from imported hemp fibers. From Portland comes Tree-Free 
Ecopaper, a hemp/ straw blend along the lines of a smooth 
newsprint.  Unlike wood pulp, hemp paper is estimated to last 1500 
years without fading or deterioration. Imagine a copy of the Bay 
Guardian being around that long!


Evanescent Press, in Legget California, produces luxurious art papers, 
all of which are stocked or can be ordered at the Hemporium. 
Evanescent makes a 16x20 replica of the Declaration of 
Independence- serving as a gentle reminder that the founding 
fathers wisely drafted the document on hemp, finalized it on inferior 
parchment- only $23.00.  

For health nuts, there is 100% Hemp seed oil, pressed in the good ol' 
U S of A from Indian hemp seeds.  One drop of this nutritive oil goes 
a long way in a massage.  Hungry?  Whip it up in a tasty salad 
dressing to benefit from it's essential fatty acids. The most 
polyunsaturated oil on the planet runs a hefty $20.00 per 8.5 oz 
bottle. Or if you're feeling enterprising, get a 4 oz bag of seed for 
$3.95 , and squeeze out the oil yourself.

For the devoted Deadhead on your list, there are tie-dyed hackysack 
balls of 100% hemp cloth, and stuffed with hemp seeds- $12.00.  
Green hemp baseball caps are available for $25.00-. small price 
considering your grandchildren might be wearing it someday. 
Slightly more subtle is the hemp hanky- natural colored, and 
inscribed with it's hemp content- at only $3.00.

But the most intriguing item in the store is a 100% hemp rug.from 
China. This colorful, tight knotted, thick napped carpet looks and 
feels like a wool/silk blend.  It is carved in the traditional Chinese 
style, with the chop "Ma"(hemp) emblazoned in jade green.  A perfect 
meditation rug or a stylish doormat for $295.00.  

All of the partners at the Cannabis Center and Hemporium are active 
in the hemp movement, and offer something for free- knowledge.
