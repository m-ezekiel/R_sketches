On New Years Eve a friend (called Mick) and myself
bought some heads. We  went to a park near the 
backpackers hotel that we were staying, layed down on the 
grass and rolled a joint. We shared the joint; as time progressed
I began to become engrossed in the magnificent complexity on the
grass. Every blade was a perfect, yet individual creation, that
literally shone. As I became more and more engrossed in this
beautifull piece of nature I noticed that the brown leaves were
being transformed into three witches sitting around a pot, I don't 
know how long I was experiencing this when Mick tapped me on the
shoulder and suggested we go for a walk. While walking down the
street I saw a policeman looking in our direction, then I heard
several loud bangs, I immediately realized that we must have walked
into the middle of a massacre. Mick must have realised this too
as we immediately leapt down into the grass . As soon as we reached 
the ground the penny dropped. The bangs were New Years Eve fireworks
and the policeman was probably looking in our direction wondering 
whether we were  crazy or stoned. Upon 
realising our error we cracked up laughing. We heard a siren, we  assumed
that it must be the police coming to get us so we ran and hid behind 
a tree. When it was safe we walked back to the hotel as it had a 1a.m. 
curfew. I walked down a corridor that seemed endless. I eventually
came to a door. I opened it, not really knowing where I was. Fortunatly
it was my dormitory, I watched the end of the fireworks and went
to bed.
