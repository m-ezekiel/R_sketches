     Our challenge to the world:  Try to prove us wrong - if all fossil fuels

and their derivatives (coal, oil, natural gas, synthetic fibers and

petrochemicals) as well as the deforestation of trees for paper and

agriculture (e.g., Brazilian & Indonesian rainforests), are banned from use

in order to save the planet, preserve the ozone layer and reverse the

greenhouse effect with its global warming trend:


     Then there is only one known renewable natural resource able to provide

ALL of the following goods and essentials such as paper and textiles; meet

all of the world's transportation, home and industrial energy needs, and clean

the atmosphere - all at the same time - our old standby that did it all

before:  Cannabis Hemp...Marijuana!

     The industrial revolution moved hemp to a place of lesser importance in

world commerce due to the lack of mechanized harvesting and breaking

technology needed for mass production.  But this natural resource was far too

valuable to be relegated to the back burner of history forever.


     In 1916, a U.S. Department of Agriculture bulletin predicted that once a

decorticating and harvesting machine was developed, cannabis would again

become America's largest agricultural industry.  Some 22 years later,

"Popular Mechanics" introduced a new generation of investors to just such a

device, (See the February 1989 issue of High Times) which brings us to this

next bit of history:


  A Plan to Save our Forests

<*--------------------------*>


     Some cannabis plant strains regularly reach tree-like heights of 20 feet

or more in one growing season.


     In 1916, the U.S. Department of Agriculture wrote in special bulletin

No. 404 that one acre of cannabis hemp, in annual rotation over a 20-year

period, would produce as much pulp for paper as 4.1 acres of trees over the

same 20-year period being cut down; and this process would use only 1/5 to

1/7 as much sulfur-based acid chemicals to break down the glue-like lignin

that binds the fibers to the pulp.


     All this lignin must be broken down to make pulp paper.  Hemp is only 4%

lignin, while trees are 18-30% lignin.  Thus hemp provides four times as

much pulp with five to seven times less pollution (and yet, today is totally

illegal as it has been for the last half-century.)


     This hemp pulp-paper potential depended on the invention and engineering

of new machines for stripping the hemp by modern technology.  This would also

lower the cost of and demand for lumber for housing and at the same time help

re-oxygenate the planet.


     As an example:  If the new (1916) hemp pulp paper process were legal

today, it would soon replace about 70% of all wood pulp paper, including

computer printout paper, corrugated boxes and paper bags.


     Pulp paper made from rags or machined from 60% to 100% hemp hurds is

stronger and more flexible than paper made from wood pulp and makes less

expensive, more ecological paper, and a better one.


  Conservation and Source Reduction

<*---------------------------------*>


     Source reduction is a cost-cutting waste control method often called for

by environmentalists:  reduction of the source of pollution, usually from

manufacturing with petrochemicals or their derivatives.


     In the supermarket when you are asked to choose paper or plastic for

your bags, you are faced with an environmental dilemma; paper from trees that

were cut, or plastic bags made from fossil fuel and chemicals.  With a third

choice - hemp hurd paper - available, one could choose a biodegradable,

durable paper from an annually renewable source, the hemp plant.


     The goal is to reduce the source of pollution.  Whether the source of

the pollution is CFC's (chloro-flouro-carbons) from spray cans, computers

and refrigeration, or tritium and plutonium produced for military uses, or

the sulfuric acids used by paper makers, reducing the source of pollution is

the goal.


     The environmental advantages of harvesting hemp annually - leaving the

tress in the ground! - make paper making from hemp hurds critical for source

reduction, along with the use of hemp to replace fossil fuel as an energy

source.


  Energy and the Economy

<*----------------------*>


     The book "Solar Gas" (1980), "Science Digest," "Omni Magazine," The

Alliance for Survival, the "Green Party" of West Germany and other put the

total figure of our energy costs at 80% of the total dollar expenses of

living for each human being.


     In validation:  82% of the total value of all issues traded on the New

York Stock Exchange, other world stock exchanges, etc., are tied directly to:


- Energy supply companies (Exxon, Shell, etc.) wells/coal mines (Con Edison

and so forth);


- Energy transportation (pipeline companies, oil shipping and delivery

companies) or;


- Refineries and retail sales (Exxon, Mobil, Shell, So. California Edison, NY

Edison, et al.)


     Americans - 5% of world population - in their drive for more 'new worth'

and 'productivity' use 25% to 40% of the worlds' energy.  The hidden cost to

the environment cannot be measured.  Eighty-two percent of all your dollars

translates roughly into 33 of every 40 hours you work going to pay for the

ultimate energy cost in the goods and services, on way or another

(transportation, heating, cooking, lighting) you purchase.


     Our current fossil energy sources also supply about 80% of all solid and

airborne pollution which is slowly poisoning the planet.  (See U.S. EPA

report 1983-1989 on coming world catastrophe from carbon dioxide imbalance

caused by burning fossil fuels.)  The cheapest substitute for these expensive

and wasteful energy methods is not wind or solar panels, nuclear, geothermal,

and the like, but using the evenly distributed light of the sun to grow

biomass.  The world's most efficient solar power source has already been

created.


     It is a plant.  And on a global scale, the most energy efficient plant

is hemp, and annually renewable resource able to replace all fossil fuels.


     The early Oil Barons (Rockefeller, Standard; Rothschild's, Shell; et al)

paranoically aware in the Twenties of the possibilities of Ford's methanol

scheme (Henry Ford even grew marijuana on his estate after 1937 to prove the

cheapness of methanol,) dropped and kept oil prices incredibly low, between

$1 to $4 per barrel (there are 42 gallons in an oil barrel) for almost 50

years until 1970.  So low, in fact, that no other energy source could compete

with them...and once they were sure of the lack of competition, the price

jumped to almost $40 per barrel in the next ten years.


     Suddenly, for whatever reason, we are now in an era when oil is not only

prohibitively expensive, but embargoes or wars by foreign nations, i.e.,

OPEC, Libya, Iran, etc., can virtually hold the U.S. hostage; that's how

dependent we are on foreign sources of polluting petroleum products.  Biomass

conversion to fuels should begin immediately to both stop planetary

pollution and make us energy independent.


     By the year 2000, the U.S. will have burned 80% of its petroleum

resources, while our coal reserves may last 100 years or so longer.  But the

decision to continue burning coal has serious drawbacks.


     This high-sulfur coal is responsible for our acid rain, which already

kills 50,000 Americans and 5,000 to 10,000 Canadians annually.


  Clean, Renewable Fuel Source

<*----------------------------*>


     Fuel is not synonymous with petroleum, let's get over that.  And new

hemp/biomass energy systems create millions of new jobs!


     Hemp biomass can replace every type of fossil fuel energy product.  When

hemp is grown for biomass as a renewable energy crop, CO2 (carbon dioxide) is

breathed in by the living plants to build cell structure; the left over

oxygen is breathed out replenishing earth's air supply.  Then when the carbon

rich hemp biomass is burned for energy the CO2 is released back into the air.

The CO2 cycle is balanced when the crop is grown the next year.  This is the

true meaning of recyling.


     Biomass conversion, utilizing the same 'cracking' technology employed

by the petroleum industry will make charcoal to replace coal.


     Charcoal contains no sulfur, so when it is burned for industry no sulfer

is emitted from the process.  Sulfur is the primary cause of acid rain.  The

rainfall in New England often falls between household vinegar and lemon juice

in its acidity on the -ph scale.  This is bad for every cell membrane it

contacts, doing the most harm to the simplest life forms.


     The biomass cracking process also produces non-sulfur fuel oil to

replace fossil fuels.  Again, no sulfur is released and the new CO2 doesn't

rise when harvested biomass is used for fuel.


  Biomass for Energy Abundance

<*----------------------------*>


     The gasses that remain after the charcoal and fuel oils are extracted

from hemp can be used for driving electric power co-generators, too!


     This biomass "cracking" process can produce methanol or charcoal fuel,

as well as the basic chemicals of industry:  acetone, ethyl acetate, tar,

pitch and creosote.  The Ford Motor Co. successfully operated a biomass

'cracking' plant in the 1930's at Iron Mountain, Michigan, using trees.  Hemp

was too costly at that time, due to the labor costs of hand harvesting.


     Finally, hemp seed contains 30% (by volume) oil.  This oil makes high

grade diesel fuel oil and aircraft engine and precision machine oil.

Remember, throughout history, hemp seed was made into fuel oil:  The Genii's

lamp burned hemp seed oil, as did Abraham the prophet's and Abraham Lincoln's.


     Only whale oil came near hemp seed oil in popularity for fuel.


     When Rudolph Diesel invented his diesel engine, he intended to fuel it

"by a variety of fuels, especially vegetable and seed oils."


     Of course all these benefits can come from hemp, a plant uniquely suited

to grow and thrive practically anywhere on Earth and to be used to reclaim

marginal land and help ease the desertification of the planet.


     Hemp is 77% cellulose, a basic chemical feed stock (industrial raw

material) used in the production of chemicals, plastics and fibers.  Depending

on which U.S. agricultural report is correct, an acre of full grown hemp

plants can sustainably provide from four to 50 to even 100 times the

cellulose found in a cornstalks, kenaf, or sugar cane - the planet's next

highest annual cellulose plants.  In most places, hemp can be harvested twice

a year and, in warmer areas such as Southern California, Texas, FLorida and

the like, it could be a "year round" crop.  Hemp has a short growing season

and can be planted after food crops have been harvested.


     An independent, semi-rural network of efficient and autonomous farmers

will become the key economic player in the production of energy in this

country.


     The United States government pays (in case or in "kind") for farmers to

refrain from growing on 89 million acres of farmland each year, called the

soil bank.


     Ten million of these acres in hemp would be the equivalent of 500

million to one billion acres of corn.


     Hemp fuel derivative, along with the recyling of paper, etc., would be

enough to run America virtually without oil, except as petroleum fertilizer.


     And 10 million to 89 million acres of hemp or other woody annual biomass

planted on this restricted, unplanted fallow farmland (our soil bank) would

make energy a whole new ball game and be a real attempt at doing something to

save the Earth.


  Family Farms or Fossil Fuel?

<*----------------------------*>


     In about 10 years, when our petroleum resources have dwindled to 20% of

their original size, America will have four choices:


- Burn all our poisonous coal;


- Go to war over foreign oil;


- Cut down our forests for fuel; or


- Grow and process a variety of environmentally safe fuels from biomass.


     Farming only 6% of continental U.S. acreage with biomass would provide

all of America's energy needs and end dependence on fossil fuels.  'Illegal'

hemp is Earth's #1 biomass resource:  capable of producing 10 tons per acre

in four months.


     Hemp is easy on the soil, and ideal crop for the semi-acrid west and

open range land.  (Adam Beatty, vice president of the Kentucky Agricultural

Society, reported instances of good crops of hemp on the same ground for 15

years in a row without a decline in yield.  "Southern Agriculture," A.

Beatty, C.M. Saxon & Co., NY; 1843. P. 113.)


     It is the only biomass source available that is capable of once again

making the U.S. energy independent.


     Legal hemp would return billions of dollars worth of natural resource

potential back to the farmers and bring millions of good jobs in energy

production to America's heartland.


     Hemp energy farmers will become our producers of raw materials for many

of the nations's needs.  Family farms will be saved.


     Crops can be tailored to the needs of the nation.  Biomass can be grown

for fuel at about $30 per ton or seed crops can be pressed for oil; the left

over seed cake makes a high protein raw food resource.


     Hemp grown for fiber will bring the paper and textile industry back to

the local communities and out of the hands of multinational corporations.


  The Catch

<*---------*>


     The "catch" is obvious:  The energy companies!  They own most of the

petro-chemicals, pharmaceutical, liquor, and tobacco companies, and are

intertwined with the insurance companies and banks that own them in such a

way as to make untangling their various interlocking directorates

(plutocracies) a Herculean task for even the most dedicated researcher.


     Many politicians now in power, according to the press, are bought and

paid for by the energy companies, and their U.S. government arm is the CIA,

a.k.a. "The Company" (Robert Ludlum, et al).  The Bush/Quayle administration

is uniquely tied to oil, newspapers and pharmaceuticals - as well as the CIA.


     The world struggle for money is actually a struggle for energy, as it is

through energy that we may produce food, shelter, transportation, and

entertainment.


     It is this struggle which often erupts into war.


     It may not be that if we remove the cause, the conflicts will also be

removed, but the possibility is strong enough that we must try.


     Ultimately, he world has no other rational environmental choice but to

give up fossil fuel.


  Energy Security

<*---------------*>


     At this point, we can tell OPEC goodbye forever.


     The national balance of payments deficit is cast by the wayside and your

personal energy bills can be cut by at least 50% and perhaps as much as 90%

with biomass from hemp and recycled waste.


     No more elderly or poor people freezing to death or living in misery in

the winter.


     If introduced to Third World nations, hemp biomass could drastically cut

our overseas aid and reasons for war, while raising the quality of life

there by quantum leaps.  The world's economy will/should boom as it never has

before.


  Free Enterprise - High Profit

<*-----------------------------*>


     There are many other areas of the economy that would benefit from the

re-legalization of hemp and de-regulation of commerce in non-smoking hemp,

according to the non-profit Business Alliance for Commerce in Hemp (BACH).


     Research by this Los Angeles-based business association indicated there

are are around 40,000 non-smoking commercial uses for hemp that are

economically viable and market competitive.  These include:


  A Change in High Fashion

<*------------------------*>


     The arrival of newly imported hemp-cotton blended clothing from China in

1989 signals the beginning of a new era for the rapidly changing world of

fashion.  (Joint Venture Hempery and the Hemp Colony imports of shirts and

shorts with the Stoned Wear (Registered) label can be found at a number of

retail outlets or ordered through the mail.)


     Public distaste for the cruelty of using furs and leather, along with

the search for comfortable, natural fabrics to replace synthetics and

fashion-conscious society's ever-changing trends and tastes all offer a great

opportunity to re-invigorate the domestic textile manufacture and retail

trades.


     Drawing on hemp fibers' special attributes - absorbancy, insulation and

strength, clothing manufacturers and designers will once again put hemp into

linen to produce new lines of durable and attractive clothing and textiles.


     Outer wear, warm bedsheets, soft towels (hemp is more water absorbent

than cotton), diapers (even disposable ones that you don't have to cut down

trees to make), upholstery, wall coverings, natural rugs - all these can now

be designed and made from hemp:  generally better, cheaper and more

ecologically.


     Trade barriers and laws restricting the use of imported cannabis fibers

need to be removed.


     Hemp textiles will not be fully cost competitive until hemp fiber can be

grown and processed domestically, to avoid import fees and lower the costs

of transportation.


  How and Why Would You Eat Cannabis Hemp?

<*----------------------------------------*>


     The marijuana hemp seed (which is technically a fruit) is the second

most "complete" - with the eight essential amino acids - vegetable protein

source on our planet.  Soybeans alone have a bit more protein.


     However, hemp seed is many times cheaper and its protein potential can be

utilized better than soybean by the human body.  In fact, the marijuana seed

is the highest in enzymes and overall amino acids of any food on our planet,

including the soybean.


     Hemp seed extracts, like soybeans, can be spiced to taste like chicken,

steak, or pork and can be used to make tofu-type curd and margarine, at less

cost than soybeans.  (U.S. Agricultural Index; The Marijuana Farmers, 1972,

Frazier.)


     Hemp seed can be pressed for its vegetable oil, leaving a high protein

seed cake as a byproduct.  Sprouting any seed improves its nutritional value

and hemp can be sprouted and used like any other seed sprout for salads or

cooking.


     "Hemp is a favorite [bird seed] because of its nourishing oily content."

(Birds in the Garden, Margaret McKenny, 1939.)


     When cannabis hemp is grown for seed, fully half the weight of the

mature female plant is seed!


     One almost-instant potential benefit is that all domesticated animals

(dogs, cats), farm animals and poultry could be fed a nearly complete diet

with just hemp seed extract protein and fat.


     These two factors alone (everything else being equal) will allow animals

maximum weight gain for less than current costs without any artificial growth

steroids or other drugs currently poisoning the human race and food chain. 

In fact, hemp seed cake, the byproducts of oil pressing, was one of the

world's principal animal feeds until this century.


     Hemp seed can be ground into meal, cooked, sweetened and combined with

milk and made into a nutritional breakfast cereal - like oatmeal or cream of

wheat.  This type of porridge is known as a gruel.


     Hemp leaves can also be brewed into a healthy tea and either

medicinally or drunk as a beverage.


  Spectre of Worldwide Famine

<*---------------------------*>


     The marijuana seed's combination of amino acids, enzymes and edistins

make more food protein and nutrients usable, and better than anything else. 

It allows a body with nutrition-blocking tuberculosis or almost any other

ailment to get maximum nourishment.


     By itself, widespread use of hemp seed food protein would save many of

the world's children currently dying from protein starvation!  An estimated

60% of all children born in Third World countries (about 12-20 million a

year) will die this way before reaching five years of age.  Many times that

number have their lives dramatically shortened and/or brains decimated.


     Remember hemp is a hearty plant that grows almost anywhere, even in

adverse conditions.


     Furthermore, recent studies indicate that depletion of the ozone layer

threatens to reduce world soya production by a substantial amount - up to 30%

or even 40% depending on the fluctuation of the density of the ozone shield. 

But hemp, on the other hand, resists the damage caused by increasing

ultraviolet radiation and actually flourishes in it by producing more

cannabinoids which provide protection from ultraviolet light.


     Australia, as many countries have throughout history, survived two

prolonged famines in the 19th century using nothing but marijuana seeds for

protein and marijuana leaves for roughage.


     It's no wonder that some Central and South Americans hate America and

want us out; they see us as ignorant killers.  For years, our government

demanded the paraquat poisoning of their lands:  Lands these farmers had

grown cannabis on by law since 1564, when Prince Phillip of Spain had ordered

it grown throughout his empire to provide food, sails, rope, towels, sheets

and shirts - as well as providing one of the peoples most important folk

medicines for fever, childbirth, epilepsy, and poultices for rheumatism.


     Today if caught growing their old staple, cannabis, their U.S. supported

government/military expropriates their lands.  In exchange for doing this to

their people, the leaders then qualify for American foreign and military aid;

all because of marijuana, one of their peoples; oldest livelihoods, folk

medicines, food staples and joys.


  A Fundamental Biological Link in the Food Chain

<*-----------------------------------------------*>


     Our politicians who made these marijuana prohibition laws based on years

of disinformation, may have doomed not only birds but the human race to

extinction from another direction.  Birds in the wild are essential to the

food chain; and they continue to diminish in population due to - among other

things, such as petrochemical pesticides - the lack of hemp seed!


     With hemp seed in their diet, birds will live 10-20% longer.  And their

feathers have more oil, allowing longer flight.


     There were more than 10 million acres of seed-laden cannabis hemp

growing wild in the U.S. prior to 1937, feeding hundreds of millions of birds

as their favorite and most necessary food until our government began its

policy of total eradication of this most primary link in the food chain.


     Oblivious to these inherent biocide (killing all life) dangers, our

government (Reagan/Bush/Quayle/Rangel/Biden/Bennett/DuPont, et al.) continues

to escalate these programs of extinction unabated, both here and abroad, at

the insistence of the DEA.


     And not only hemp (read planet savior):  DuPont has created strains of

grain - for example wheat - that will only grow with THEIR petro-chemical

fertilizers and pesticides.  Corn is already so hybridized that it is not

expected to last 50 years without human cultivation.


     If for any reason these hybrids die out - as hybrids are apt to do - we

will be without wheat forever.


  Sturdy Paper Products

<*---------------------*>


     The devastated environments and job markets of the American Northwest

and other timber regions stand to make a dramatic comeback once hemp is

reintroduced to the domestic paper industry.


     Paper mills can return to full production levels and loggers will find

new work in hemp trades.  Truck drivers can continue to haul pulp to the

mills, and lumber for construction, although the price of lumber will go down

as other demands on our timber resources are reduced by substituting farm-

grown hemp for forest grown wood pulp.


     There will also be a lot of work to do in reforestation.  Our rivers

will go through a period of recovery following the 60-80% reduction of paper

making chemicals being dumped into them when hemp replaces wood pulp in the

paper industry.  This means more fish and more fishing, as well as increased

camping and tourism in the beautiful and vital new growth forest regions.


  Spin-Off Trades & Taxes

<*-----------------------*>


     Hemp cellulose and oils can be used for literally tens of thousands of

other uses, from paints to dynamite.


     As each new hemp trade develops, money will flow from it to re-energize

seemingly unrelated areas of the economy.  The American worker and soon-

to-be-rich entrepreneurs will bring millions of new jobs and new products to

the marketplace.


     They will also buy thousands of homes, cars and other non-hemp goods;

thus stimulating a real economic expansion based on he ripple effect, rather

than trickle-down economics - pumping money directly into the bloodstream of

the American heartland and benefitting all of society.


     Revived farms mean more purchases of equipment, and new businesses

create spin-off jobs in the shipping, marketing and commodities areas.


     Farms, banks and investment houses would also realize large profits, and

the billions of hemp-dollars in the legitimate economy would increase tax

revenues and increase the liquid capital available for investment and

purchasing of consumer goods.


     Federal, state and local government would realize a windfall of hundreds

of millions of dollars in tax revenues without raising taxes.  "If the

marijuana, cocaine and heroin markets were legal, state and federal

governments would collect billions of dollars annually," [assistant professor

of politics at Princeton University Ethan] Nadelman said.  "Instead, they

expend billions in what amounts to a subsidy of organized criminals."  (L.A. 

Times, Nov. 20, 1989, p. A-18.)


     And of course, there's all the money already being made off smoking

marijuana; $43 billion in 1988, according to the DEA.  Add to that huge (but

not suppressed) home growing and smoking accessories industries, as well as

the necessary farm equipment for production, looms, etc, and hemp could erase

the national debt in a matter of a few short years.


     Land values will rise in depressed rural areas, helping to rescue

farmers, developers and speculators who might otherwise have to default on

loans and further worsen the savings and loan crisis.


  Land & Soil Reclamation

<*-----------------------*>


     Land reclamation is the final and perhaps most compelling economical and

ecological argument for hemp cultivation.


     Until this century, our pioneers and ordinary American farmers used

cannabis to clear fields for planting, as a fallow year crop, and after

forest fires to prevent mudslides and loss of watershed.


     Hemp seeds put down a 10" to 12" root in only 30 days, compared to the

one-inch root put down by the rye or barley grass presently used by the U.S. 

Government.  Southern California, Utah and other states used cannabis

routinely in this manner until about 1915.  It breaks up compacted,

overworked soil.


     In the formerly lush Himalaya region of Bangladesh, Nepal and Tibet

there is not only a light moss covering left as flash floods wash thousands

of tons of topsoil away.


     In 1964, Bangladesh (from bhang - cannabis, la - land, desh - people)

signed an 'anti-drug' agreement with the U.S. not to grow hemp.  Since that

time the 'marijuana-land-people' have suffered disease, starvation and

decimation, due to unrestrained flooding.


     Hemp seeds sown free from airplanes flying over eroding soil could

reclaim land the world over.  The farmed out desert regions can be brought

back year after year, not only slowing the genocide of starvation but easing

threat of war and violent revolution.


  Natural Guard

<*-------------*>


     Instead of National Guard, why not establish a Natural Guard of

environmental soldiers to be our front line for survival - planting trees,

harvesting biomass (eg. hemp) from marginal farm lands and re-building the

infra-structure of America:  Our roads, bridges, dams, canals, railroad

tracks.


     Isn't this the human, civilized and socially responsible way to use our

human resources, rather than warehousing people like animals in prison?

     Our challenge to the world:  Try to prove us wrong - if all fossil fuels

and their derivatives (coal, oil, natural gas, synthetic fibers and

petrochemicals) as well as the deforestation of trees for paper and

agriculture (e.g., Brazilian & Indonesian rainforests), are banned from use

in order to save the planet, preserve the ozone layer and reverse the

greenhouse effect with its global warming trend:


     Then there is only one known renewable natural resource able to provide

ALL of the following goods and essentials such as paper and textiles; meet

all of the world's transportation, home and industrial energy needs, and clean

the atmosphere - all at the same time - our old standby that did it all

before:  Cannabis Hemp...Marijuana!
