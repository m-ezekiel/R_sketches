"Prohibition .  goes beyond  the bounds  of reason  in that it
attempts to  control a man's appetite by legislation and makes
a crime out of things that are not crimes.  "A prohibition law
strikes  a   blow  at  the  very  principles  upon  which  our
government was founded."  - Abraham Lincoln  December, 1840

Q. What is Marijuana?
 
A. "Marijuana"  refers to  the dried leaves and flowers of the
cannabis plant,1  which contain  the non-narcotic chemical THC
at various  potencies. It  is smoked  or eaten  to produce the
feeling of  being "high."  The different  strains of this herb
produce different  sensual effects,  ranging from  sedative to
stimulant.
 
Q. Who Uses Marijuana?
 
A.There is  no simple  profile of a typical marijuana user. It
has been  used for  1000s of  years for  medical,  social  and
religious  reasons   and  for   relaxation.2  Several  of  our
Presidents3 are  believed to  have smoked it. One out of every
five Americans say they have tried it. And it is still popular
among  artists,   writers,  musicians,   activists,   lawyers,
inventors, working people, etc.
 
Q. How Long Have People Been Using Marijuana?
 
A. Marijuana  has been  used since ancient times.4 While field
hands and  working people  have often  smoked the  raw  plant,
aristocrats historically  prefer hashish5  made from the cured
flowers of  the plant.  It was  not seen  as a problem until a
calculated disinformation campaign was launched in the 1930s,6
and the first American laws against using it were passed.7
 
Q. Is Marijuana Addictive?
 
A. No, it is not.8 Most users are moderate consumers who smoke
it socially  to relax.  We now know that 10% of our population
have "addictive  personalities" and  they are neither more nor
less likely  to overindulge in cannabis than in anything else.
On a  relative scale,  marijuana is  less habit  forming  than
either  sugar  or  chocolate  but  more  so  than  n  chovies.
Sociologists report  a general  pattern of  marijuana use that
peaks in  the early  adult years,  followed  by  a  period  of
levelling off and then a gradual reduction in use.9
 
Q. Has Anyone Ever Died From Smoking Marijuana?
 
A. No;  not one  single case,  not ever. THC is one of the few
chemicals for  which there  is no  known toxic  amount.10  The
federal agency  NIDA says that autopsies reveal that 75 people
per year  are high  on marijuana  when they die: This does not
mean that  marijuana caused  or was  even a  factor  in  their
deaths.
     The  chart   below  compares   the   number   of   deaths
attributable to selected substances in a typical year:
 
Tobacco.................................340,000-395,000
Alcohol (excluding crime/accidents).....125,000 +
Drug Overdose (prescription).............14,000-27,000
Drug Overdose (iilegal)...................3,800-5,200
Marijuana.....................................0

Q. Does Marijuana Lead to Crime and/or Hard Drugs?
 
A. No.11  The only  crime most  marijuana users commit is that
they use marijuana. And, while many people who abuse dangerous
drugs also smoke marijuana, the old "stepping stone" theory is
now discredited,  since virtually  all  of  them  started  out
"using" legal  drugs like  sugar, coffee, cigarettes, alcohol,
etc.
 
Q. Does Marijuana Make People Violent?
 
A. No.  In fact,  Federal Bureau  of Narcotics  director Harry
Anslinger once told Congress just the opposite - that it leads
to non-violence  and pacifism.12  If he  was telling the truth
(which he  and  key  federal  agencies  have  not  often  done
regarding marijuana),  thethee-legalizing marijuana  should be
considered as  one way  to curb  the growing  violence in  our
cities.
 
     The simple  fact is  that marijuana  does not change your
basic personality.  The government  says that  over 20 million
Americans still  smoke it,  probably  including  some  of  the
nicest people you know.
 
 
Q. How Does Marijuana Affect Your Health?
 
A. Smoking  anything is  not healthy,  but marijuana  is  less
dangerous than  tobacco and people smoke less of it at a time.
This health risk can be avoided by eating the plann instead of
smoking it13  or can  be reduced by smoking smaller amounts of
stronger marijuana.
 
     There is no proof that marijuana causes serious health or
sexual problems14  but, like  alcohol, its  use by children or
adolescents is  discouraged. Cannabis is a medicinal herb that
has hundreds  of proven,  valuable  therapeutic  uses  -  from
stress reduction  to glaucoma  to asthma  to  cancer  therapy,
etc.15
 
Q. What About All Those Scary Statistics and Studies?
 
A. Most  were prepared  as scare tactics for the government by
Dr. Gabriel  Nahas, and  were so  biased and unscientific that
Nahas was  fired by  the National  Institute of  Health16  and
finally renounced  his own  studies as  meaningless.17 For one
experiment, he  suffocated monkeys for five minutes at a time,
using prorortionately more smoke than the average user inhales
in  an   entire  lifetime.18  The  other  studies  that  claim
sensational health  risks are  also highly suspect, since they
lack controls  and produce results which can not be replicated
or independently verififi.19
 
Q. What Can I Do About Marijuana?
 
A. No  independent government panel that has studied marijuana
has ever  recommended  jail  for  users.20  Concerned  persons
should therefore  ask their legislators to re-legalize and tax
this plant,  subject to  age limits and regulations similar to
those on alcohol and tobacco.
