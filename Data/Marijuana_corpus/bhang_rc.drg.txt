I am posting this for David Heisterberg, djh@osc.edu, whose news
is "perpetually broken."  Don't blame me if it gives you a tummy-ache
or gets you in trouble in any other manner:

With the weekend coming up, you might find use for this recipe for bhang
from _Flavors_of_India_ by Shanta Nimbark Sacharoff.

2 cups water
1 ounce marijuana (fresh leaves and flowers of a female plant preferred)
4 cups warm milk
2 tablespoons blanched and chopped almonds
1/8 teaspoon garam masala [a mixture of cloves, cinnamon, and cardamon]
1/4 teaspoon powdered ginger
1/2 to 1 teaspoon rosewater
1 cup sugar

Bring the water to a rapid boil and pour into a clean teapot.  Remove
any seeds or twigs from the marijuana, add it to the teapot and cover.
Let this brew for about 7 minutes.  Now strain the water and marijuana
through a piece of muslin cloth, collect the water and save.  Take the
leaves and flowers and squeeze between your hands to extract any liquid
that remains.  Add this to the water.  Place the leaves and flowers in
a mortar and add 2 teaspoons warm milk.  Slowly but firmly grind the
milk and leaves together.  Gather up the marijuana and squeeze out as
much milk as you can.  Repeat this process until you have used about
1/2 cup of milk (about 4 to 5 times).  Collect all the milk that has
been extracted and place in a bowl.  By this time the marijuana will
have turned into a pulpy mass.  Add the chopped almonds and some more
warm milk.  Grind this in the mortar until a fine paste is formed.
Squeeze this paste and collect the extract as before.  Repeat a few
more times until all that is left are some fibers and nut meal.
Discard the residue.  Combine all the liquids that have been collected,
including the water the marijuana was brewed in.  Add to this the
garam masala, dried ginger and rosewater.  Add the sugar and remaining
milk.  Chill, serve, and enjoy.

It seems a bit labor intensive, but then it is meant as an offering to
Shiva.
