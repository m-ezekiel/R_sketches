(Sorry this took me a while.  News has been screwed up around here for
the last week or so.)

Here, as promised, is the list of state statutes recognizing the
medical value of marijuana.  There are only 30 states in this list (29
+ Mass).  ACT (the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics) claims that
there are 34.  If anyone knows what the other four are, I'd like to be
informed.

Thanks once again to ACT for the info.

If you would like more information on marijuana's medical use please
contact the Alliance at (202) 483-8595.

The Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics (ACT) is a Washington based
patient-rights group founded in 1980.  For more than a decade the
Alliance has provided patients and policy makers with up-to-date
information on marijuana's important therapeutic uses.

(I am not connected with ACT in any way.  I merely requested
information from them, and they complied.  I am now in the process of
passing some of that information on to others.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amazingly enough the last three states that I have lived in are on the
list.  Texas, North Carolina and Oklahoma.  If you can convince the
legistators in *these* three states about something as radical as the
medical use of marijuana, the evidence in favor must be overwhelming
indeed.  (Believe me, none of the legislatures in these states could
be considered 'liberal' by any stretch of the imagination.)
