Hemp Tour Sept. 19, 1992 / Gainesville Heats Up  

   It was beautiful. Hundreds swirled forward in a spontaneous burst of joy 
accompanying the man with the hundreds of marijuana cigarettes as he tossed 
them in the air. From the stage and perimeter that much sudden movernent was
alarming. The burst of pot smoke approached that of an army tear gas drill in 
volume. Florida legalization Organization organizers were totally relieved to 
discover the nature of the commotion; police were not. Suddenly it was a 
question of police vs. too much marijuana smoke . They threatened arrests if 
smoking continued. Organizers announced it would be an individual decision, 
whether or not to light up, but hearing the speakers was more important. More
smoke. More threats. Organizers used PA to inform the crowd of their right to 
remain silent, their right to refuse to be searched. In the event of arrests 
the crowd was urged to go to the police station for an all night vigil or 
until the judge arrived and released everyone. Police were asked to leave the
Plaza and when they hesitated they were asked to get the Chief of Police on 
the phone. Things settled down. No arrests. No injuries. Few if any 
complaints. Many participants said they've never had more fun in their 
life (sic). Goodwill prevailed throughout.

   Events began with a stunninq Hatha Yoga demonstration and class by Michael 
Geison of the Florida Legalization conspiracy to suppress hemp. Charles 
Manheart spoke for the Libertarian Party of Florida and Herb Shapiro spoke on 
the Kennedy assassination. Other speakers included: Kevin Aplen - CAN, Pat 
Cannon - TEACH, Ken Wise - FIJA, Gainesville Greens. 3000 people were in 
attendance. The bands Reptilian Complex, Jahscendance, Johari Window & Tone 
Unknown were terrific as always. 75 new VOTERS REGISTERED. Booths, venders, 
hemp museum.
   The next FLO rally is scheduled for a tentative October or November '93. 
(However, the Spring Hemp Tour has just been announced. Look for it elsewhere
in this issue. Ed.)

   Yeah, I know that this a bit dated BUT I've been intrigued by these kinds
of rallys (including the "Inhale to the Chief" held in Washington) and can't
help wondering whether they do more to antagonize lawmakers or wake them up.
