This one time my and a friend were sitting in my basement looking for
something to do.  It was about 1:30-2:00 a.m. and we decided we wanted
to see "The Doors" yet again.  Living in a small town, we couldn't
find a 24 Hour video place so we headed into Edmonton.  Only about a
20 minute drive.  We found a Video Station on the West End and went
in.  They had it so I went out to my car to get my registration so I
could get a membership card.  On my way back to the store, some guy
come up and asked me if I wanted some smoke.  I figured it was pretty
risky so I said no man.  He told me he would give me 2 for $20 (going
rate up here is 15 per gram).  I figured what the hell and gave the
guy a 20 after he gave me the bag.  I went in, rented the movie and
then we headed back.  I pulled the bag out and you should have seen
the look on my friend's face.  She flipped.  There was about 3 grams
in there and it was some really wild shit.  We got back into the Grove
(city I live in) and smoked a few refers and watched the Doors until
about 5:30.  She headed home and I got a few hours sleep before work.
Talk about being in the right place at the right time...
