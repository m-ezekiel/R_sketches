Hello all,
 
The other evening I was chatting with a fellow prohempster, and although she
was somewhat enlighten about the politics of POT and the WoD several questions
led to a general summary of WHY things are the way the are in MY opinion.
 
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Why (I think) pot is illegal, a general overview for starting a discussion
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 
1). The Dupont & Hurst families and Money.
 
2). Pharmaceuticals profits and politicians protecting them and profiting
    from them. This includes especially the BUSH, QUAYLE, and Reagan's
    and the manufacturing tax free in Puerto Rico (really big $$).
 
3). The war machine. So many lives depend upon incomes, jobs, positions,
    ranks, etc derived from this WoD and it's supporting industries. To
    supposedly protect us all from being one of the 3,000 who die from
    drugs each year (while none of these fatalities ever were from
    marijuana).
 
4). The Church's and politicians 'doing' what they imply or say is not only
    right for them but for everyone even if the politician personally does
    not agree....it is 'politically correct' to oppose drugs and include
    marijuana in that category.
 
5). Illegal Drugs = more profits. (Even in Holland I have met persons who
    are near militant in their desire to keep marijuana in it's current
    state of tolerated but not allowed to advertise openly, restricted to
    'certain coffee shops' etc. this protect their profits). Here in the
    states, illegal drugs equal higher profits for even our government.
    Just look at the top informants, they can only go so far 'til it
    circles right back to our own government and they are told to pursue
    it no further. Anyone hearing of Oliver North, Barry Seals, etc get
    the idea. Check-out A&E investigative reports on informants.
      Not to mention the way our government resorts to kidnapping and
    bringing to justice foreigners who may step out of line. And the large
    monies we spend to 'aid' those governments in fighting the WoD at their
    level, but if they do attempt to fight it they are killed, however the
    money must flow to them or it appears we are leaving them out to dry
    (bad publicity). Or the wasted dollars on 'pet' projects for various
    politicians (like the radar balloons in South Texas, who cost millions
    and have known 'gaps' and work only in 'good' weather).
 
6). The Control of Dosage Issue.... Our people tell us that 'it varies from
    dose to dose' therefore is can't be properly administered as a
    prescription. This one is as much to blame on the WoD. In the USA, if
    you need pot for medical use, you get whatever you can find thru
    whomever you may or may not be able to trust, and the quality is
    whatever you get. Harder drugs are often cut to increase profits,
    marijuana is sometimes cut as well as cheaply or quickly dried and
    sugar water (possibly worse) are added as bonding agents for
    pressing/bricking. Sugar especially adds undue harshness and more
    toxins for the smoker.
      However all this is almost mute in a tolerant society such as Holland.
    Marijuana in Holland is separated from other breeds and quality is a
    high priority, I have actually seen arguments about this topic, usually
    one asking for xxx and getting xyx or such. One look and sniff by the
    dealer and it is usually settled quickly. (I.E. they KNOW their DOPE!)
      This one area is a possible point, but in a free'r society it is very,
    very, VERY close from crop to crop within a 'brand'.

Now, Why it should be legal, again in my opinion & brief
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 
1). Medical use. Estimates as high as 50% of the (often expensive &
    dangerous) commercial market would be lost to medical pot & it's
    derivatives or components and it's cheaper (if legal, often even
    illegal still cheaper, as many of you know 'scripts often cost from
    one to several hunndred dollars) not to mention safer, without
    addiction or other adverse effects as it's legal counterparts.
 
2). Fuel, diesel and methanol.
 
3). Paper without dioxins.
 
4). Foliage (reverse the greenhouse effect and clean-up some of this
    pollution).
 
5). Food, both human and animal.
 
6). Rope
 
8). Cloth
 
9). Recreation / Socially
 
10). Religious (Coptic and Rastafarian, possibly more)
 
11). Artistic....Free your mind
 
12). Therapy, personal (Mental, stress reduction etc)
 
13). Stop the Profit!!!
 
14). Stop The Warehousing of users / prison (it is a social/personal
     issue not a criminal one).
 
15). Reduce the jails and associated cost and problems
 
16). Stop the paranoia, of users, of thoughts of crime, guilt, of those
     needing to or desiring to use.
 
17). Because it is a natural HERB and not a DRUG (drugs are man made in
     the USA). Watch out, they are about to regulate all herbs it appears.
 
18). Because we all 'go to pot' (pun) now and then. Percentages of Americans
     who have used or occasionally use is extreme. A major political factor
     if they all voted or had a clear vote available. (Line item veto ? and
     lets vote on it all and not leave it to them to decide what is
     publicly voted on. Give the public the option.
 
19). Because God made it, not man. (so I read, for you SCI-FI buffs it might
     be associated with those other unexplained ancient mysteries....  :-)

Well there it is, most of it is brief, pickup a copy of the Emperor and other
publications for references, or attack some of these 'POINTS OF enLIGHTenment'.
 
{most of this was off the top of my head after a lenghtly conversation}
 
Peace to all, blunt the chronic (conditions) :-)
 
Sincere sympathies to the Gary Shephard - Jones family (Sept. 18, 1993).
