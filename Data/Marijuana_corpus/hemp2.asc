5 Things you can do RIGHT NOW to help legalize hemp/marijuana

1. Talk about hemp/marijuana today to friends, family, co-workers
and everybody. Just say you think hemp/marijuana should be made
legal again. You'll be amazed at how many agree. Talk about
medical marijuana, free choice and non-smoking commercial hemp
(rope, paper, fabric, fuel, oil, food, etc.). Be proud of what
you believe. This is America. Remember, you're in good company:
Both Washington & Jefferson were hemp farmers.  People needing
legal help should call NORML.

2. Photocopy Literature to pass out and send with your letters.
Always keep it handy. You never know who or when somebody will
want it. Give it out at meetings, events, campuses, etc.

3. Write letters to your elected officials (see scripts below),
newspapers, magazines, TV & radio stations. Be brief. Be clear.
Don't mix issues. Better yet, write at least one letter every
month, and every time there is an editorial or commentary on
marijuana or "drugs." Respond to articles and events or just
state your opinion. They'll read it, even if they don't publish
it. 4. Help out a local group. Come to meetings. Make phone
calls, do office work, fold and mail literature, etc. Share your
special skills (like computer, data entry, research, speaking,
organizing, art and other talents.) If there is no group, start
one. It's easier than you think. The groups listed at the bottom
of this page are glad to help.

5. Donate money to active groups like NORML, BACH, HEMP, the
American Hemp Council, Freedom Fighters and others. Contribute
supplies or postage. All groups need access to free or cheap
printing service. Donate books and magazine subscriptions to
schools and libraries, maybe even buy an ad or billboard space to
get out the message. It's better to spend a little money now to
re-legalize hemp/marijuana than a lot of money later to stay out
of jail.

Whatever you do, Start Doing It Right Away! Studies show that if
you don't get started within a day or two, you might not ever get
around to it, and we have to act today to build the momentum we
need to re-legalize hemp/marijuana tomorrow.

Dear_________________________,

     Please take whatever action is necessary to legalize
personal use of marijuana and see to it that everyone who needs
it for medicine receives it immediately.
     Also, you must know that the barriers to commercial use of
hemp for paper, fabrics, fuel and so on hurt our economy, and
must be removed immediately.  It just doesn't make any sense to
punish farmers and people whose businesses don't have anything to
do with drugs at all.

Representative:__________________:

Dear_____________________________:

     Please act immediately to legalize personal use of marijuana
and see to it that everyone who needs it for medicine receives it
immediately.
     Also, you must realize that the barriers to non-drug,
commercial use of hemp for paper, fabrics, fuel, and so on, hurt
our businesses and the state economy.  They must be removed
immediately, because if other states do this before we do,
Colorado will lose its competitive edge in bringing in new
businesses and the jobs and tax revenues that come with it.
     In addition, it is a waste of tax money to enforce
prohibition laws when we have so much real crime to deal with.
     You say you are for a strong Colorado and America.  Well, do
something about.

                                        Sincerely,

Phone Script: Hello, by name is____________________and I'm
calling to register my opinion with (Senator, Representative,
etc.)_________________. I think it's time to re-legalize personal
use of marijuana and see to it that everyone who needs it as
medicine receives it immediately.
     Laws that block commercial use of hemp for paper, fabrics
fuel and so on hurt our economy and the environment.  They should
be completely eliminated.  It doesn't make sense to punish
American Farmers and people whose businesses don't have anything
to do with drugs. I want to know what (Sen.,Rep.,etc.)
____________________ is doing about this problem.(Give them your
address and ask for a written reply.)
