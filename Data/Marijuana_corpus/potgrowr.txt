             MARIHUANA: HOW TO GROW IT, REAP IT, AND COOK IT.

       A prime anarchist production, typed in from anarchist cookbook.



Marihuana is available anywhere in the country, as the black market is
widespread and thriving very well.

   There are many different methods of growing marihuana, and it seems
everyone
has just discovered the best fertilizer.  I could not relay all the methods in
five books, so have settled for the technique that has been proven most
successful.

  Most seeds are fertile, but the best are from Mexico. Never under any
circumstances throw seeds away, since marihuana is a weed and will grow almost
anywhere. The first step is to soak your seeds overnight in clean, lukewarm
water. YOur container should be a standard planter box. If this is not
available, a plastic dish tray about two inches deep will serve uset as well.
Fill the container with washed fine sand and shredded sphagnum moss. If this
is
not readily available, you can use regular soil. The soil should be packed
firmly, and watered well so that the excess water is allowed to run off. Dig
furrows the full length of the container about one-half-inch deep. Now you are
ready to sow your seeds. Do so every inch. Fill in each furrow with soil,
sand,
moss, and water. Cover the container with a clear plastic sheet, and place it
in a warm location where there are at least six hours of sunlight a day. The
plants now remain on their own until they develop their first true leaves.

  Even it the material above is not available, almost the same degree of
success can be accomplished by placing the seeds on several layers of water
soaked paper towels. Now cover the seeds with a plastic sheet jsut as above,
and expose to sunlight.

   In about one week, signs of life should start to appear. Within two weeks,
definite little leaves should be present. This is the time to transplant.  The
plot you intend to use for your transplant should be carefully prepared.
Manure should be used for at least one week in advance of the actual
transplant. The soil should be similar to the original soil used in the
germinating box. All other weeds, in the general area of your plot, should be
pulled to allow your plant as much freedom as possible.

   The original germinating box should be watered the day before you are going
to transplant, so as to make the move easier and less traumatic on the
plants.The plants should be placed in holes two to three inches deep,
depending
on the size of the plant. The earth around the plant should be loose, and if
possible, some earthworms should be added. If there is a lack of sunlight, a
simple ring of tinfoil around the plant can be very helpful. The first few
days
are the msot critical after the actual transplant. If the plants survive the
shock, there should be no reason why they shouldn't grow into healthy, fully
grown plants (which means, in certain climates, fifteen to twenty feet high).

   Very little care is needed after this stage, with the exception of
fertilization. For fertilizers, one can use manure, soluble nitrogen, nitrate
of soda, sulfate of ammonia, or rotting garbage (which has always been
popular).  To produce a stronger plant, on can clip off the lower leaves; do
this only when the plant reaches a height of at least three feet. The ground
surrounding your plant should be kept clear of other weeds, but strangely
enough, insects ignore marihuana and do virtually no harm.

   As a rule, it is better to wait until the plants have gone to seed before
they are cut, but if you're greedy, you  can kill the goose that laid the
golden egg.  The best agent for drying is the sun, but if you live in the city
it could prove embarrassing and dangerous to have five- or ten-foot pot trees
on your fire escape- in this case a sun lamp can be used. When using the sun,
drying usually takes about two weeks. With a sun lamp, the pot is smokable
after only three or four days. When drying is done, seperate the leaves and
crush them. This will be the finest smoke, unless you have a female plant. If
so, save the blossoms for the most potent smoke there is. The stems and twigs
can be chopped up and smoked in a pipe, or sold to a friend.

   Grass is basically a weed and can be grown anywhere, including indoors with
artificial light. A sun lamp works well from a distance of two to three feet.
For an interesting experiment, use infra -red light on part of your crop and a
sun lamp on the other part, then compare. A bathtub or cement mixer is an
ideal
planter for the city dweller.
