Introduction,

There are a variety of bongs that can be made out of almost anything.  Some
are better than others and some require more amounts of time.........anyway 
here is a list of bongs that are commonly used today.

SIMPLE BONGS               |_|

-2 Liter bong

1.  Take one empty 2 liter bottle (without cap).
2.  Place a small sheet of tin foil over the top of the bottle. 
3.  Push your thumb down on the foil (pushing it through the top untill your
thumb is about half way in the bottle.
4.  Fold the remaining foil around the bottle.
5.  Take a pin or small sharp object, (I use my Swiss Army knife) and poke
little holes in the tin foil (not to big or the pot will fall through).
6.  Now get something like a bic pen and take it apart.  Take the hollow 
shell of the pen.
7.  OK, make a hole mid way down the bottle just big enough to fit the pen in.
8.  Now, smoke and get high

self explanatory)    |          \_-_-_-/   | |

                     |_____________________|_|  
1.  Make a cup shaped dent in the side of the can (towards the back)
2.  Make little holes in the dent (get a swiss army knife, it makes life a 
lot more easier).


Gravity Hits-

You'll need: one gallon of bottled water, one empty liter bottle, tin foil, 
swiss army knife.

1.  Cut a hole in the jug of water  (wide enough so that the liter bottle can
fit through)  DON'T POUR THE WATER OUT THOUGH!!!!.


2.  now cut the botom off the liter bottle.
3.  place the tin foil over the top of the liter bottle (make holes)
4.  push the liter down in the jug of water.
5.  Now, put in pot, hold a lighter up to it, and pull up on the bottle until 
it almost goes above the water line.
6.  unsrew cap of liter bottle and suck in until you feel water.  (if the 
smoke is really harsh it helpes to swallow a little of the water, don't take 
a lot though.)


Epalogue........

This text file is the first in 4 files about bong making/using.  This
file is only about simple bongs.  I am going to get some plans on how to make
some "Hi-Tech" bongs pretty soon.
