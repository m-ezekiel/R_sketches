Most seeds are fertile, but the best are from Mexico. Never throw your seeds away, for pot is a weedand can be grown almost anywhere.

1) First, soke your seeds overnight in clean, lukewarm water.

2) Obtain a planter box. If this is not avaliable, a plastic dish tray about 
   two inches deep will serve just as well.

3) Fill the container with washed fine sand and shredded sphagnum moss. If this    is not readily avliable, you can use regular soil. The soil should be
   packed firmly, and watered well so that the excess water is allowed to run      off.

4) Dig furrows the full length of the container about one-half-inch deep. Now,     you can sow your eeds. Do so every inch. Fill in each furrow with a clear 
   plastic sheet and place it in a warm location where there are atleast 6    hours of sunlight a da.

5) The plants are on their own until they develop their first true leaves.   

* Even if the material mentioned above is not avaliable almost the same degree 
  of success can be accomplished by placing the seeds on several layers of   water-soaked paper towes. Now cover the seeds with a plastic sheet just as
  above, and expose to sunlight.

** In about a week, signs of life should appear. Within two weeks, definite 
   little leaves should be present. This is the time to transplant.

Transplanting)-

1) The soil should be similar to the original soil used in the germinating box.
   Make sure you pull up all other weeds in the general area allowing your    plant as much freedom f growth as possible.

2) The original germinating box should be watered the day before you are going
   so as to make the move easier on the plants, and cut root damage to a    minimum. The plants shoud be placed in holes two or three inches, depending    on the size of the plant. 

3) If there is a lack of sunlight, a small amount of tin foil around the plant
   can be very helpful for the first few days are the most critical after the
   actual transplant.

4) If the plants survice the shock, there should be no reason why they    shouldn't grow into health, fully grown plants (which means, in certain    climates, fifteen to twenty feet high).  

Care)-

Very little care is needed after this stage, with the exception of fertilization. For fertilizers, oe can use a soluble nitrogen, nitrate of soda, sulfate of ammonia, or rotting garbage. Remember the round around your plants should be clear of weeds, but strangely enough, insects and marijuana do noharm.

Harvesting)-

When the plants are obviously ready to be cut, you must prepare a place for them to dry. The best dring is in the sun, but if you live in the city, it could be embarrasing and dangerous to have five o ten fifteen-foot marajuana trees hanging out of your fire escape. In this case, a sun lamp may be ued.
When using the sun, drying usually takes about two weeks. With a sun lamp, the pot is ready after ony three or four days. When drying is done, take the leaves and crush them. This will be used as smok, and you know the story from there.

* I have found that when the seeds are first growing, that the rain has almost    no effect if thereis good enough covering. Otherwise, it may flood. Have 
  fun!...
