           Well you've grown your plant...But it's not quite

        ready for harvest...And you wanna get high?!..Damn!...

        I have a SIMPLE solution to your problem!...Make your

        own resin from your growing plant!!!


      -----------------------------------------------------------


Here we go!

    1) Get your plant ready for some fun!

    2) Clean your hands...YES clean em!

    3) Lightly grab your plant with your hands flat.

    4) Briskly slide your hands together (Like your chanting!)

    5) Do this up and down the length of the plant for approx.1/2hr.

    6) Your hands SHOULD be dark BLACK now...that's resin boy...

    7) Have a clean sheet of paper or a cloth laid out flat and ready.

    8) Pick the resin off your hands onto the cloth/paper.

    9) Clean your hands AGAIN!...YES!

   10) Once they are clean lump the resin together off the cloth.

   11) Now you should have a BIG (4-5 grams) chunk of resin.

   12) This last tip should be EASY...Load the bowl and TOKE!

   13) One last thing...after a day or two when the plants
       "recover" you may do the process AGAIN!...
